<h2>I.&mdash;THE OLD MAN.</h2>


<p>Our first walk is naturally to climb the Coniston Old
Man. By the easiest route, which fortunately is the
most interesting, there is a path to the top; good as
paths go on mountains&mdash;that is, plain to find&mdash;and by its very
steepness and stoniness all the more of a change from the
town pavement and the hard high road. It is quite worth
while making the ascent on a cloudy day. The loss of the
panorama is amply compensated by the increased grandeur of
the effects of gloom and mystery on the higher crags, and with
care and attention to directions there need be no fear of losing
the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>About an hour and a half, not counting rests, is enough for the
climb; and rather more than an hour for the descent. From the
village, for the first ten minutes, we can take two alternative
routes. Leaving the Black Bull on the left, one road goes up past
a wooden bridge which leads to the Old Forge, and by Holywath
Cottage and the gate of Holywath (J. W. H. Barratt, Esq., J.P.)
and the cottages of Silverbank, through a gate opening upon the
fell. Turn to the left, past sandpits in a fragment of moraine
left by the ancient glacier which, at the end of the Ice Age, must
once have filled the copper-mines valley and broken off here,
with toppling pinnacles and blue cavern, just like a glacier in
Switzerland. Note an ice-smoothed rock on the right, showing
basalt in section. Among the crannies of Lang Crags, which tower
above, broken hexagonal pillars of basalt may be found in the
screes, not too large to carry off as specimens. In ten minutes
the miniature Alpine road, high above a deep ravine, leads to the
Gillhead Waterfall and Bridge.</p>

<p>An alternative start may be made to the right of the Post
Office, and up the lane to left of the Sun Hotel; through the
gate at Dixon Ground, and over a wooden bridge beneath the
mineral siding which forms the actual terminus of the railway.
Another wooden bridge leads only to the grounds of Holywath,
but affords a fine sight of the rocky torrent bed with Coniston
limestone exposed on the Holywath side. The Coniston limestone
is a narrow band of dark blue rock, with black holes in
it, made by the weathering-out of nodules. It lies between
the softer blue clay-slates we have left, which form the lower
undulating hills and moorlands, and the hard volcanic rocks
which form the higher crags and mountains.</p>

<p>The cartroad to the right, over the Gillhead Bridge, leads
to the copper mines and up to Leverswater, from which the
Old Man can be climbed, but by a much longer route. We
take the gate and rough path to the left, after a look at the
fine glaciated rocks across the bridge, apparently fresh from
the chisel of the sculpturing ice; the long grooves betray the
direction in which the glacier slid over them in its fall down
the ravine. From a stile over the wall the copper mines
become visible above the flat valley-bottom, filled with sand
from the crushing of the ore. The path leads up to the back
of the Scrow among parsley fern and club moss, and fifteen
minutes from the bridge bring us through a sheepfold to
another stile from which Weatherlam is finely seen on the
right, and on the left the tall cascade from Lowwater. A
short ten minutes more, and we reach the hause (<i>háls</i> or neck)
joining the crag of the Bell (to the left) with the ridge of the
Old Man up which our way winds.</p>

<p>Here we strike the quarry road leading from the Railway
Station over Banniside Moor, a smoother route, practicable
(as ours is not) for ponies, but longer. Here are slate-sheds,
and the <i>step</i> where the sledges that come down the steep upper
road are slid upon wheels. The sledge-road winds round the
trap rocks of Crowberry haws (the grass-grown old road
rejoins it a little higher) and affords views, looking backwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of Coniston Hall and the lake behind. Five minutes above
the slate-sheds the road finally crosses Crowberry haws, and
Lowwater Fall comes into view&mdash;a broken gush of foam down
a cleft 500 feet from brow to base.</p>

<p>A shepherd's track leads to the foot of the fall and to the
Pudding Stone, a huge boulder&mdash;not unlike the famous
Bowder Stone of Borrowdale&mdash;a fragment from the "hard
breccia" cliffs rising behind it, namely, Raven Tor high above;
Grey Crag beneath, with the disused millrace along its flank;
and Kernel Crag, the lion-like rock over the copper mines.
Dr. Gibson, the author of <i>The Old Man, or Ravings and
Ramblings round Conistone</i>, writing half-a-century ago, says:&mdash;"On
this crag, probably for ages, a pair of ravens have
annually had their nest, and though their young have again
and again been destroyed by the shepherds they always return
to the favourite spot." He goes on to tell that once, when the
parent birds were shot, a couple of strange ravens attended to
the wants of the orphan brood, until they were fit to forage
for themselves. On this suggestion, Dr. John Pagen White
has written his poem in <i>Lays and Legends of the English Lake
Country</i>, fancifully describing the raven on Kernel Crag
watching from prehistoric antiquity the changes of the world
around it, through past, present and future, to the crack of
doom!</p>

<p>From the Pudding Stone experienced climbers can find
their way up the ledges of Raven Tor to the top of Lowwater
Fall. We follow the sledge road, and in five minutes reach
Saddlestones Quarry, with its tram-lines and tunnelled level,
and continually increasing platform of "rid" or débris.</p>

<p>Ten minutes' walk from the quarries brings us to Lowwater,
with glimpses of Windermere in the distance, and Leverswater
nearer at hand under the summit of Weatherlam. It is worth
while turning off to the right hand to see the great blocks of
stone that lie in the margin of the tarn, and at the head of the
fall.</p>

<p>As we climb the zigzags to the highest quarries, over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
slate which stands out in slabs from the sward, the crags of
Brimfell and Buckbarrow opposite seem to rise with us. It is
here, on a cloudy day when the tops are covered, that the
finest impressions of mountain gloom may be found; under
the cloud and the precipices a dark green tarn, savage rocks,
and tumbling streams; and out, beyond, the tossing sea of
mountain forms.</p>

<p>From the platform of the highest quarry, reached in ten
minutes from the tarn, a rough and steep path to the left leads
in five minutes more to the ridge, and the view of the lowland
bursts upon us with the Westmorland and Yorkshire hills in
the distance. Below, as Ruskin wrote when he first climbed
here in 1867, "the two lakes of Coniston and Windermere,
lying in the vastest space of sweet cultivated country I have
ever looked over,&mdash;a great part of the view from the Rigi
being merely over black pine-forest, even on the plains."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes more take us up this steep arête to the top,
2626 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>There used to be three ancient cairns&mdash;the "Old Man"
himself, his "Wife" and his "Son":&mdash;<i>man</i>, the Celtic <i>maen</i>,
being the local name for a pile of stones, and the <i>Old Man</i>
simply the name of the cairn, not of the whole mountain.
These were destroyed to build the present landmark. The
circle of stones we have passed marks the place of the Jubilee
bonfire of 1887; the flare-lights of King Edward's coronation
were shown from the top of the cairn, where in the days of
fire signals was a regular beacon station.</p>

<p>The view on a clear day commands Ingleborough to the
east, Snowdon to the south, the Isle of Man to the west, and
to the north, Scafell and Bowfell, Glaramara and Skiddaw, Blencathra and Helvellyn: and beneath these all the country
spread out like a raised model, with toy hills and lakes and
villages. It is so easy to identify the different points with the
help of the map, that it is hardly necessary to name them in
detail. Under the distant Pennines of Yorkshire lie Windermere,
Esthwaite Water, and Coniston with Monk Coniston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Tarns at its head. Southward,&mdash;over Walney Scar, Blind
Tarn and Dow Crags close at hand,&mdash;are the shores of Morecambe
Bay and the Duddon Estuary, with Black Combe
rising dark against the sea. Westward, across the Duddon
Valley, the steep rocky summits of Harter Fell and Hard
Knott. The group close under our feet to the north includes
Brimfell, Woolcrags, and the Carrs, with Grey Friar on the
left and Weatherlam on the right, and in their hollows
Lowwater and Leverswater. To the east of Helvellyn are
Fairfield, Red Screes and Ill Bell, above the russet sides of
Loughrigg and the distant detail of Ambleside.</p>

<p>At any time it is a fine panorama; but for grandeur of
mountain line Weatherlam is the better standpoint. To walk
along the ridge over springy turf is easy and exhilarating after
the toil of the stony climb; and the excursion is often made.
A mile to the depression of Levers Hause, another mile past
Wool Crags and the Carrs, down Prison Band (the arête
running eastward from the nearer side of the Carrs) to the dip
at Swirl Hause; and a third mile over Blacksail, would bring
you to Weatherlam Cairn. And a red sunset there, with a
full moon to light you down the ridge to Hole Rake and the
copper mines and home, is an experience to remember.</p>

<p>But for most of us enough is as good as a feast; and
Weatherlam deserves a day to itself, and respectful approach
by Tilberthwaite Gill. This walk leads from the village past
Far End up Yewdale, turning to left at the sign post, and up
between Raven Crag, opposite, and Yewdale Crag. At the
next sign post turn up the path to the left, passing Pennyrigg
Quarries, and then keep the path down into the Gill. The
bridges, put up by Mr. Marshall, and kept in repair by the
Lake District Association, lead through the ravine to the
force at its head. Thence Weatherlam can be ascended either
by Steel Edge, the ridge to the left, or breasting the steep
slope from the hollow of the cove.</p>

<p>From the top of the Old Man we have choice of many
descents. By Levers Hause we can scramble down&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
looks perilous but is easy to a wary walker,&mdash;to Leverswater;
and thence by a stony road to the copper mines and
civilization.</p>

<p>By Gaits Hause, a little to the west of the Old Man, we
can reach Gaits Water, and so across Banniside Moor to the
village: or we can take the grassy ridge and conquer Dow
Crags with a cheap victory, which the ardent climber will
scorn. He will attack the crags from below, finding his own
way up the great screes that border the tarn, and attack the
couloirs,&mdash;those great chasms that furrow the precipice.
Only, he should not go alone. Here and there the chimney
is barred by boulders wedged into its narrow gorge: which to
surmount needs either a "leg up," or risky scrambling and
some nasty jumps to evade them. These chimneys are described
with due detail in the books on rock-climbing, but
should not be rashly attempted by inexperienced tourists.</p>

<p>The simplest way down is along Little Arrow Edge. The
route can be found, even if clouds blot out bearings and
landmarks, thus. In the cairn on the top of the Old Man there
is a kind of doorway. You leave that doorway square behind
you, and walk as straight as you can forward into the fog&mdash;not
rapidly enough to go over the edge by mistake, but confidently.
Your natural instincts will make you trend a trifle
to the left, which is right and proper. It you have a compass,
steer south south-east. In five minutes by the watch you will
be well on the grass-grown arête, thinly set with slate-slabs,
but affording easy walking. Keep the grass on a slightly
increasing downward slope; do not go down steep places
either to right or to left, and in ten minutes more you will
strike a ledge or shelf which runs all across the breast of the
Old Man mountain, with a boggy stream running through it&mdash;not
straight down the mountain, but across it. If you strike
this shelf at its highest point, where there is no definite stream
but only a narrow bit of bog from which the stream flows, you
are right. If you find the stream flowing to your right hand,
bear more to the left after crossing it. Five minutes more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
jolting down over grass, among rough rocks which can easily
be avoided, and you see Bursting Stone Quarry&mdash;into which
there is no fear of falling if you keep your eyes open and note
the time. By the watch you should be twenty minutes&mdash;a
little more if you have hesitated or rested&mdash;from the top.
Long before this the ordinary cloud-cap has been left aloft,
and you see your way, even by moonlight, without the least
difficulty towards the village; but though mist may settle
down, from this quarry a distinct though disused road leads
you safe home.</p>

<p>In ten minutes from the quarry the road brings you to
Booth Tarn, through some extremely picturesque broken
ground, from which under an ordinary sunset the views of the
nearer hills are fine, with grand foreground. Booth Crag
itself stands over the tarn, probably named from a little bield
or shelter in ruins in a nook beneath it; and where the quarry
road comes out upon Banniside Moss, the Coniston limestone
appears, easily recognisable with its pitted and curved bands,
contrasting with the bulkier volcanic breccia just above.</p>

<p>Beyond the tarn to the right are the volunteers' rifle-butts
with their flagstaff. Take the path to the left, and in five
minutes reach the gate of the intake, with lovely sunset and
moonlight views of the Bell and the Scrow to the left, and
Yewdale beyond; Red Screes and Ill Bell in the distance.
Hence the road is plain, and twenty minutes more bring you
past the Railway Station to Coniston village.</p>

<p>To give a good idea of the lie of the land there is
nothing like a raised map. A careful and detailed coloured
model of the neighbourhood (six inches to the mile, with the
same vertical scale, so that the slopes and heights are not
exaggerated, but true to nature) was made in 1882 under the
direction of Professor Ruskin, who presented it to the Coniston
Institute, where it has been placed in the Museum.</p>

<h2>II.&mdash;THE LAKE.</h2>

<p>Coniston Water it is called by the public now-a-days,
but its proper name is Thurston Water. So it
is written in all old documents, maps, and books up
to the modern tourist period. In the deed of 1196 setting forth
the boundaries of Furness Fells it is called <i>Thorstanes Watter</i>,
and in lawyer's Latin <i>Turstini Watra</i>, which proves that the
lake got its title from some early owner whose Norse name
was Thorstein; in Latin, Turstinus; in English, Thurston. In
the same way Ullswater was Ulf's water, and Thirlmere was
Thorolf's mere, renamed in later times from a new owner
Leathes water&mdash;though in the end the older title finally
prevailed.</p>

<p>As a first rough survey it will be convenient to take the
steam gondola, and check off the landmarks seen on her trip,
an all too short half-hour, down to the waterfoot.</p>

<p>The start is from the pier near the head of the lake, at the
quaint boathouse built seventy years ago, in what was then
called the Gothic style, for the late Mr. John Beever of the
Thwaite&mdash;the house on the slope of the Guards Wood above
the Waterhead Hotel. The boathouse stands on a promontory
made by Yewdale Beck, which falls into the lake close at hand,
and brings down with every flood fresh material to build its
embankment farther and farther into the lake. So rapidly is
its work done that a boulder is pointed out, twenty yards
inland, which was always surrounded by water twenty or
thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Another cause helps to hasten their work, for it is in this
part that the waves under the prevailing south-west winds
attain their greatest size and strength. The steamer captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
who lives here says that he has measured waves 65 feet long
from crest to crest, five feet high from trough to crest. These
great waves dash back the stones and gravel brought down by
the becks and spread it northwards, embanking it in a ridge
under the water from this point to Fir Point opposite. Dr.
H. R. Mill, by his soundings in 1893, found the deepest part
of the little northern reach to be hardly more than 25 feet;
this was close to the actual head of the water, showing that it
is the débris brought down by the Yewdale and Church Becks
which is silting up the bed.</p>

<p>Looking round this northern reach, which the gondola does
not traverse in her voyage, opposite is Fir Point, with the
boathouse of Low Bank; a little higher up in a bay, the twin
boathouses of Lanehead and Bank Ground; then the landings
for Tent Lodge and Tent Cottage, and the bathing house
and boathouse belonging to Victor Marshall, Esq., of Monk
Coniston Hall, in the woods at the head of the lake. At the
true waterhead, where the road from Hawkshead joins the
road round the lake, used to stand the Old Waterhead Inn.
Nearer us are the boathouses at Kirkby Quay, and the pier of
the (new) Waterhead Hotel.</p>

<p>Leaving the steamer pier we are at once in deep water.
The soundings increase rapidly off the mouth of Church Beck,
just below Mason and Thwaites' boathouse; the bottom,
gently shelving for a few yards out, suddenly goes over a
bank, and down at a steep angle to a depth of 125 feet. On
the evening of August 5th, 1896, a boy named George Gill
sank there out of reach of his companion, and was drowned
before help could be got. At the very moment the Parish
Council in the village was discussing regulations for boating
and bathing. The sad news brought the members down to
the waterside for a painful object-lesson in the necessity of
life-saving apparatus. By private effort, in the absence of
public authority, life buoys and lines have now been provided
at the boathouses and piers, and it is hoped that all will co-operate
in the proper use of such means in case of need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now passed the boathouse of Coniston Bank on
the left, and Coniston Hall on the right. Between the two the
lake is at its broadest&mdash;nearly half-a-mile. Land's Point on
the right narrows the lake to a third of a mile. Looking back,
Yewdale Crag stands finely over the waterhead; Brantwood is
opposite. Between Coniston Bank and Brantwood (fishermen
and boat sailors may note) there is a shoal nearly rising to
the surface in low water&mdash;a bank of stiff clay, about 50 yards
off the east shore. On the right hand, in the second field
below Land's Point, the dark-looking bank just above the
foreshore is a mass of slag, the remains of an ancient
bloomery or smelting furnace; and in the next field called
the "Springs," half a mile below Land Point, there is another
bloomery site, marked by a tree-grown hillock. Behind these,
plantations cover the site of the ancient deer park of Coniston
Hall. Exactly opposite the "Springs" bloomery is a promontory
formed by Beck Leven, on which Ruskin's seat marks
a favourite point of view embracing the whole of the waterhead
and the crags around. Across the road from this seat and
close to the beck are the slag mounds of another bloomery.</p>

<p>We are now crossing the deepest part of the northern basin
of the lake, where Dr. Mill found over 150 feet of water. The
bottom rises, when we pass Hoathwaite boathouse on the
right, to little more than 125 feet, and off Fir Island deepens
again, attaining 184 feet half a mile farther down&mdash;making
this the deepest of the lakes after Wastwater, Windermere,
and Ullswater, as its 5-1/2 miles of length makes it the longest
except Windermere and Ullswater. Its normal level is 143
feet above the sea, though it rises and falls in drought and
damp weather as much as six feet. Of the form of its bed Dr.
Mill says:&mdash;"If the water were reduced to sea level, there
would remain two small lakes, the southern measuring one
mile and a half in length, and a quarter of a mile in breadth,
and having a maximum depth of 42 feet; the northern one,
separated by a quarter of a mile, being only 9 feet deep, three-quarters
of a mile long, and perhaps 200 yards wide at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
most. Quite possibly the two might be connected by a
channel, and give a long shallow lake of two and a half miles"
(<i>Bathymetrical Survey of the English Lakes</i>, p. 39). This bank
or dam between the two deeps is not caused by filling up from
any stream like that at the steamer pier; it points to the fact,
more strikingly seen in Windermere, that these long lakes,
like most of the long valleys, are not mere troughs or grooves
ploughed in the rock, but a series of basins, partly filled up
with glacial débris, and partly joined together by glacial
erosion, which broke and planed away the dividing barriers.</p>

<p>Fir Island (formerly from its owner called Knott Island,
now the property of Arthur Severn, Esq., R.I., J.P.) is low and
close to the water's edge, hardly distinguishable except by its
grove of Scotch firs from the rest of the coast. In very dry
weather it becomes a peninsula, but usually a boat can make
the circumnavigation, though there is risk of shipwreck on the
sharp rocks to the landward side. Near it, beyond the road
which winds prettily along the uneven and craggy shore, are
the ruins of Copland's Barn; and above it the great larch
woods of the Heald, on a noble slope of nearly 700 feet from
the brow of the fell to the lake. The western shore is formed
by the long and varied slope of Torver Common, down which
runs the Moor Gill. At its foot, exactly opposite Copland's
Barn, is the most extensive of the bloomeries, with the ruins
of an old hearth still to be found.</p>

<p>At last the continuous skylines are broken. On the left, a
steep dingle runs up among rocks and woods to Parkamoor, a
lonely farm on a bleak brow top; and on the right, the valley
of Torver begins to open out, with glimpses of Dow Crags and
the Old Man in a new aspect, showing their precipices boldly
against the sky, and beneath them Sunny Bank and Oxness
at the mouth of Torver Beck.</p>

<p>Peel Island is now before us, a crag standing romantically
out of the water, and rich with varied foliage. From its
western brink the bed of the lake runs rapidly down to a
depth of more than 100 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The island itself was for a while known as Montague Island,
from its owner. It was sometimes called the "Gridiron," for
it is made up of a series of bars of rock, so to say, with a long
projecting "calf rock" that stood for the handle. It might as
well be called the ship, with the cockboat astern. But the old
original name was Peel Island, which to a student of place-names
indicated that it once was used as a fortress; and
permission being asked from the agent of the owner, the Duke
of Buccleugh, some little excavations were made, which
revealed ancient buildings and walls, with pottery of an early
mediæval type and other remains, which can be seen in the
Coniston Museum. But Peel Island is such a jewel of natural
beauty that antiquarian curiosity hardly justified more than
the most respectful disturbance of its bluebells and heather.</p>

<p>Below this, the shores become more indented and more
picturesque; the hills around do not fall off into tameness, as
at the feet of some of the lakes. On the right is the Beacon,
with its cairn conspicuous at 835 feet above sea; on the left,
Selside rises to 1,015 feet. Opposite is Brown How, or Brown
Hall, prettily built at the water's edge; and on the long nab
that stretches half-way across the lake is the old mansion of
Water Park (A. P. Bridson, Esq.).</p>

<p>The gondola slows down and rounds to the little pier, on
one of the loveliest bits of all our lakeland scenery. Five
minutes' walk takes you up to the Lakebank Hotel, and from
its terrace&mdash;still better from the knoll above it when the
surrounding trees are bare or lopped&mdash;the view embraces
(beginning from the left) the Beacon, Dow Crags, the Old
Man, and Weatherlam; Helvellyn, with Yewdale Crag and
Raven Crag beneath; Fairfield and Scandale Head, with
Loughrigg below (Red Screes and Ill Bell are not visible), and
the lake's whole length with all its wooded promontories. To
the right, across the water, the village of Nibthwaite, with
cottages nestling under the steep and rocky mountain edge,
and ruined quay which formed, before the railway tapped the
traffic of Coniston, the terminus of its ancient waterway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Formerly this lake, like Derwentwater, boasted a floating
island&mdash;a mass of weeds and water plants detached from the
bottom, and carrying enough solid matter to make it a kind of
natural raft. In the floods and storms of October, 1846, it
was stranded near Nibthwaite, and remained thenceforward
indistinguishable from the rest of the shore.</p>

<p>Thurston Water used to be famous for its char, which were
thought to be even finer and better than those of Windermere.
Sir Daniel Fleming of Rydal notes in his account book, under
the date February 19th, 1662 (1663, new style):&mdash;"Given unto
Adam Fleming for bringing eleven dozen of charres from
Conistone, for four pies 1s. 6d.;" and he used to send presents
of Coniston char pies, as the most acceptable of delicacies, to
his distinguished friends in London. In the middle part of
the nineteenth century the turbid or poisonous matter washed
into the lake by the streams from the copper mines, then in
full work, is said to have killed off both char and trout; but it
is an ill-wind that blows nobody good, and the cessation of
copper mining has left the water pure again. The Angling
Association has restocked the lake from Windermere, and is
breeding fish by thousands from spawn in its pond near
Coniston Hall. Both the red char (the larger sort, with red
bellies and red pectoral fins) and the silver char (with silvery
backs and orange bellies) are now caught, and opportunities
for fishermen are increasing with every year.</p>

<p>Pike, the natural enemies of char and trout, are kept down
by netting, but are often taken with the line; for example, two
of 16 lbs. each were caught by Mr. Rylands in August and
September, 1897, with yellow phantom and red wagtail. Perch
abound, and afford exciting sport to less ambitious amateurs
of the gentle craft. There are eels, too, and minnows in
abundance, and an occasional stray salmon. Otters are
hunted in the summer. Along the shore a quiet observer may
sometimes startle one from his repose, and in bowery nooks
or up the mouths of the becks may note the blue gleam of the
flitting kingfisher.</p>

<h2>III.&mdash;THE MOORLANDS AND THEIR
ANCIENT SETTLEMENTS.</h2>

<p>The moors around Coniston are full of curious and
interesting remains&mdash;cairns, circles, camps and settlements&mdash;of
the remotest age in which this country was
inhabited. Lying away from the high roads they are comparatively
little known, but can easily be reached in the
course of a day's walk or on horseback, or else by cycling&mdash;so
far as the cycle will go, which is usually within a short distance
of the spots to be sought&mdash;and leaving the cycle to the honesty
of the country folk.</p>

<p>These remains are described by Mr. H. Swainson Cowper,
F.S.A., in "The Ancient Settlements, Cemeteries, and Earthworks
of Furness" (<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. liii., 1893, with plans),
and some of them have passing notice in books relating to the
district. Their very rudeness is a source of interest, and the
mystery of their origin offers a fresh field for antiquarian
research. To the unlearned visitor they are no less interesting&mdash;if
he can throw his imagination back to wild days of ancient
Britain, and repeople the heather and rocks with Children of
the Mist. In their day the valleys were choked with matted
forest or undrained swamp; the moorlands alone were healthy
and habitable; not so bare and bleak as now, but partly
sheltered, in their hollows and watercourses, by groves of
rowan and birch, holly and yew, and the native forest trees of
the north. Around these settlements the wilderness swarmed
with red deer and roe, wild swine and cattle, capercailzie and
moor fowl of every kind&mdash;good hunting, with only the wolf pack
to dispute the spoil; for there is no reason to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
war, in our sense of the word, has ever invaded these homesteads
and cattle-garths of primitive hunting and pastoral folk,
whose chief foes were the wild beasts of the fells. Nor should
we suppose that the circles are Druid temples where human
sacrifices were offered. Some are the fences built around
graves, and others are the foundations of round houses like
the huts which wood-cutters still make for their temporary
lodging when they are at work in a coppice. Others may
have been sacred places; but let us withhold our fancies until
we have seen the facts.</p>


<h3>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Blawith and Kirkby Moors.</span></h3>

<p>The Beacon of Blawith, already noticed, can be climbed in
about half-an-hour from Lakebank Hotel. South of the cairn
on the top is Beacon Tarn, and two miles south-west over the
heather (in which are various unimportant cairns and platforms,
perhaps ancient, but more probably "tries" for slate)
rises Blawith Knott, and beyond, at its foot where four roads
meet, the Giant's Grave. The Giant's Grave can be easily
reached by road; 2-1/2 miles from Woodland Station, or 4 miles
(<i>via</i> Blawith and Subberthwaite) from Lakebank. This walk,
as described, is well under 10 miles by cross roads. The story,
still current in the neighbourhood, tells that in the Heathwaite
"British settlement" (half a mile south of the cross roads)
lived a race of giants, of whom the last was shot with an
arrow on the Knott and buried in the grave; and, on opening
it, the Rev. Francis Evans found calcined bones and charcoal.</p>

<p>The Heathwaite settlement consists of the foundations of
ancient dwellings, just to the north of Pewit Tarn, and
surrounded by extensive ruined stone walls, and a great
number of cairns. Many of these are mere heaps of stones
thrown together by the farmers to clear the land, in order to
mow the bracken which they carry away for litter. Some of
the cairns and walls, however, appear to be ancient.</p>

<p>A mile and a half south of this, on the headland to the right-hand
side of the road, just before we reach Burney Farm, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the ruined enclosure, roughly square, with a party wall across
the middle of it, known as the "Stone Rings." The walls are
of a type seen in the British settlement near High Borrans,
Windermere, and at Urswick Stone Walls&mdash;that is to say,
flanked by big slabs set on edge, as though the builders were
rudely trying to imitate the Roman walls of rubble thrown
into an outer casing of masonry.</p>

<p>Following the road for a mile to south-east, shortly before
coming to the Goathwaite Quarries, in the heather on the left
may be found a small ring embankment; and about a mile as
the crow flies south-east of this, across a little valley and only
to be reached by a somewhat roundabout road, is the remnant
of what was once a fine stone circle (quarter of a mile north
of Knapperthaw).</p>

<p>Looking south-west from here we see a pass across Kirkby
Moor, to the left of the rounded summit (over 1,000 feet)
opposite. From the top of that pass, a short mile to the west,
is a conspicuous grey cairn of loose stones, which was opened
by Mr. Jopling (author of <i>A Sketch of Furness and Cartmel</i>,
1843), and found to contain burnt bones in a prehistoric
"kist" of flagstones.</p>

<p>Turning south from this, by a grassy track through the
heather, five minutes' walk brings us to the "Kirk," a ring
embankment on the brink of the gill which encloses the site
on two sides, probably sepulchral, and perhaps connected with
the great cairn, as there are the remains of an avenue of
standing stones leading in that direction. A field near this is
called "Kirk Sinkings," with which compare "Kirk Sunken,"
the name of the Swinside Circle, and of other similar sites.
<i>Kirk</i> or <i>Currock</i> does not imply a consecrated spot, but is the
common word (surviving from the "Cumbrian" or Welsh) for
stone monuments.</p>

<p>From this, twenty minutes westward down a steep road
through the picturesque gill brings us to Kirkby Watermill
and Church (Norman door and font, and a tombstone in the
chancel which combines the simple cross with rudimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
effigy). Kirkby Hall, a mile to the north, is a fine specimen of
the ancient manor house. Another mile northward is Grizebeck,
with remains of a ring embankment, unimportant, behind
the cottages. Hence it is a little over two miles to Foxfield, or
three to Broughton; or, omitting Grizebeck, from Kirkby
Church ten minutes' walk brings us down to Kirkby station.</p>


<h3>2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bethecar and Monk Coniston Moors.</span></h3>

<p>South of Lakebank, turning to left down a narrow lane
through the hamlet of Water Yeat, we reach Bouthray
(Bouldery) Bridge over the Crake, and see, half a mile further
down, the new Blawith Church on the site of an old Elizabethan
chapel. Opposite it, across the river by a footbridge,
is Low Nibthwaite bobbin mill&mdash;in the eighteenth century an
important "forge" where iron was smelted with charcoal.</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge, and leaving Arklid Farm on the right,
1-1/2 mile from Lakebank brings us to Nibthwaite, whence the
lakeside road leads in about 7-1/2 miles to Coniston Church,
past Brantwood and Waterhead; the path to the moors strikes
up to the right hand and across the breast of Selside. Another
path leads to the Top of Selside, 1,015 feet, with Arnsbarrow
Tarn and Bell Beck descending from it, to the south-west,
with several good waterfalls. Bethecar Moor is between Bell
Beck and Nibthwaite&mdash;fine broken ground, which seems to
have been less inhabited than the other moors, for no remains
except a cairn (1-1/4 mile due west of Waterpark) have been
reported.</p>

<p>Two miles north of Nibthwaite is Parkamoor, which in the
Middle Ages was a sheep cote belonging to Furness Abbey.
Recently, walled up in an outbuilding, on a deserted farm
near at hand, part of a woman's skeleton was found. There
is an obscure story of an old lady who disappeared after
residence at Parkamoor some generations ago, but nothing
has been proved as to the supposed murder; nor is there any
reason to connect this with an alleged ghost at Coniston Bank,
several miles distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence the path to the right goes to Satterthwaite, down
Farragrain Gill; northward, a track leads over the Heald,
with magnificent views, to the lonely hill farm of Lawson Park,
another Furness Abbey sheep cote (2-1/2 miles), and down to
Lanehead and Coniston (3-1/4 miles); or by a cart track met 1/4
mile above Lawson Park, and leading upward and northward,
we can traverse Monk Coniston Moor, and descend to civilisation
by the lane that crosses from Grizedale to Lanehead.
Along the ridge which forms the boundary between Monk
Coniston and Hawkshead is High Man (922 feet), where in a
cairn is a stone with the initials "J. W., 1771" and "E. D.,
1817," and on the west side of the stone "T. F., 1817"&mdash;evidently
a <i>merestone</i> or boundary mark. A circle and other
cairns have been noted near this summit; the circle may be
comparatively modern, the ruins of a hut such as charcoal-burners
make for temporary lodgings in the woods.</p>

<p>High Cross, where the Coniston, Ambleside, and Hawkshead
roads meet, is close at hand, 2-1/2 miles from Coniston
Church.</p>


<h3>3.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Banniside and Torver Moors.</span></h3>

<p>Up the road behind the Railway Station, in twenty-five
minutes you reach the gate of Banniside Moor, which we
passed in descending the Old Man. Along the quarry road
to the right towards Crowberry Haws, about a third of a mile
from the gate, below you on the right-hand side is an ancient
garth of irregular rectangular shape, with a circular dwelling
in the middle of the highest side. A small outlying building is
just to the south-east. This seems more modern in type than
some of the remains we find in the moors, but it is difficult to
classify and impossible to date.</p>

<p>Returning to the gate, follow the Walna Scar path over
Banniside to the south-west for ten minutes; 300 yards west
of the flagstaff is a ring-mound on a levelled platform at the
edge of Banniside Mire, formerly a tarn, but now almost
peated up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Rather more than half a mile south-west of the flagstaff you
strike Torver Beck, after passing many clearing-heaps among
the bracken beds&mdash;the subject of Dr. Gibson's dialect sketch
of "Bannasyde Cairns" in <i>The Folk-speech of Cumberland</i>.</p>

<p>Clearings and tries for slate, old limekilns and pitsteads and
sheepfolds and so forth, are traps for the amateur antiquary.
But in many cases, as we have seen, and shall find in the
course of our day's walk, digging has proved that the cairns
on these moors were actually the graves of prehistoric people,
or forgotten sites of ancient habitation. Much remains to be
explored; and the "enclosure" we come to, a few steps down
Torver Beck, is a case in point.</p>

<p>It is a ruined stone wall forming an irregular quadrangle,
through which a cart-track now runs. Within it is what looks
like a hut circle on the brink of the ravine, from which water
could be got by simply letting a backet down into the stream
beneath. Across the beck, about 100 yards to the south-west,
Mr. Cowper notes another ring-mound "badly preserved,
without entrance or trenches."</p>

<p>Going due south to the footbridge across Tranearth Beck
(or the Black Beck of Torver), and then striking up Hare
Crags to the south-east (about two-thirds of a mile from the
last), we come to a large ring-mound with double ditch,
intrenching the top of the hill. From this, descending to the
south-west and crossing the beck by another footbridge, we
strike a path leading north-west in half a mile to Ashgill
Bridge and Quarry.</p>

<p>Along the ridge of Bleaberry Haws (1/4 mile south-west) is
yet another ring-mound on the edge of a lake basin, now peat
moss; and 200 yards farther we find the northern angle of the
Bleaberry Haws dyke, a more important example of the kind
seen on Hawkshead Moor.</p>

<p>Following the dyke to the south-west and turning to the left
where it disappears, we find a circle of seven stones, into
which Mr. Cowper dug, and found a rough pavement of
cobble-stones at a depth of two to three feet resting upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
natural rock. Many cairns are passed on going a few steps
eastward to strike the main line of the dyke, which runs down
into Bull Haw Moss, making a curious fold or fork at the
farther side of the valley, and then climbing the steep bank
and running over the top due south, until it loses itself among
a group of cairns in which Mr. Cowper found prehistoric
interments. The dyke is altogether over a mile long, partly a
stone wall, partly an earthwork. Antiquaries have been much
divided over its possible use and object; the late W. Jackson,
F.S.A., thought it might be a kind of deer trap. The deer
would be driven from the south-west along the moorland
valley, and <i>cornered</i> in the fork of the wall.</p>

<p>From the southern extremity of the dyke a path leads down
to the road from Broughton Mills to Torver. Two miles south-west
along this road, and between it and Appletreeworth Beck,
Dr. Kendall of Coniston has noticed a similar dyke. The
name of a neighbouring farm, Burnmoor, suggests the recognition
of "borrans" or stone heaps of more than usual
importance. In the Burnmoor above Eskdale are important
stone circles.</p>

<p>Torver Station is rather more than a mile from the point
where we struck this road, and Coniston 2-1/2 miles more by
road or rail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coniston is a good centre for further excursions in search of
moorland antiquities. From Woodland station a day's round
might be made by Broughton Mills to the cairns and enclosures
on the south side of Stickle Pike and above Stonestar; across
the Duddon to the ruins of Ulpha Old Hall, Seathwaite, the
home of "Wonderful Walker" (born at Undercrag, 1709;
died at Seathwaite, 1802, in the 67th year of his curacy there);
then back by Walna Scar, passing ancient remains of undetermined
age. The first group is found by turning to the
right below the intake wall until a stile is reached, below
which, and beyond, are traces of rude building. On rejoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the road up Walna Scar, a gate is seen across the beck;
through it and about a quarter of a mile horizontally along the
breast of the hill are extensive ruined walls, and many outlying
remains on a shelf of the mountains about 1,000 feet
above the sea. Hence the way to the top of the Scar is plain,
and Coniston is about an hour's easy walking by a well-marked
path from the summit.</p>

<p>Swinside Circle is about 4-1/2 miles from Broughton station,
and is little inferior to the great circle near Keswick. On
digging it we found nothing at all; we learnt, however, that
the place was not used for interments or sacrifices, and its
origin remains a mystery.</p>

<p>Other prehistoric sites within reach of Coniston are Barnscar
and Burnmoor (by the Eskdale railway); Urswick Stone
Walls, Foula, Sunbrick Circle and Appleby Slack, Pennington
Castle Hill and Ellabarrow in Low Furness; and Hugill
British Settlement near Windermere station.</p>

<h2>IV.&mdash;EARLY HISTORY.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Roman Period.</span></h3>

<p>There are no Roman remains at Coniston; but a
great Roman road passed just to the north of the
township from the camp, still visible, at Ambleside,
through Little Langdale, over Wrynose and Hardknott to the
camp at Hardknott Castle, and so down Eskdale to the port
of Ravenglass, where at Walls Castle there are the site of a
camp and the ruin of a Roman villa. It is possible that a
trackway used in Roman times passed through Hawkshead,
for fragments of Roman brick have been found at Hawkshead
Hall and a coin at Colthouse (see Mrs. H. S. Cowper's
<i>Hawkshead and its Neighbourhood</i>: Titus Wilson, Kendal,
sixpence).</p>

<p>There is a tradition that the Coniston coppermines were
worked by the Romans; but there is no evidence to prove it.
One point that tends to suggest the possibility of such a belief
is that about the year 85 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, soon after Agricola had overcome
all this part of the country, a certain savant, Demetrius
of Tarsus, fellow-townsman of St. Paul and not much his
junior, was sent by the Emperor Domitian to Britain, it would
seem for the purpose of enquiring into its products, especially
in metals (Canon Raine, <i>York</i>, p. 17). Two bronze tablets,
dedicated by this Demetrius to the gods Oceanus and Tethys,
were found at York, and are now in the museum there; and
on his return from these savage regions he went to Delphi and
told his traveller's tales to Plutarch, who mentions the fact
in his treatise <i>On the Cessation of Oracles</i>. It might be said
that these rich copper mines could hardly fail to attract the
notice of the conquerors; of whom their own Tacitus says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
speaking of their disappointment in the pearl fishery of Britain&mdash;"I
could more easily believe that the pearls are amiss, than
that we Romans are wanting in 'commercial enterprise.'"
<i>Avaritia</i> is the old cynic's word, in the life of Agricola, chap.
12.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">British Period.</span></h3>

<p>After the Romans left, until the middle of the seventh
century this district remained in the hands of the Cumbri or
Welsh, who probably dwelt in some of the ancient moorland
settlements we have already visited. They have perhaps left
traces in the language, but less than is often asserted.</p>

<p>Some have thought "Old Man" to be a corruption of the
Welsh <i>Allt Maen</i>, "high stone" or "stone of the slope." But
even if it be more reasonably explained as we have suggested,
the word "man" for a stone or cairn is Welsh. Dow Crags
are sometimes dignified into Dhu Crags; but though both
"dow" and "crag" have passed into our dialect, both are of
Celtic origin. The mountain crest over Greenburn called
Carrs cannot be explained as Norse <i>Kjarr</i>, a "wood;" but
being castle-like rocks, may be from the Welsh <i>caer</i>. There
are many "combes" and "tors," "pens" and "benns" (the
last Gaelic, for some of the hill tribes may well have been
survivors of the kindred race of Celts). Of the rivers hereabouts&mdash;Kent,
Leven, Duddon, Esk, and perhaps Crake are
Celtic.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Anglian Period.</span></h3>

<p>When the Angles or English settled in the country, as they
did in the seventh century, they came in by two routes, which
can be traced by their place-names and their grave monuments.
One was by Stainmoor and the Cumberland coast,
round to Ravenglass; and the other by Craven to the coast
of Morecambe Bay. There is no evidence of their settlement
in the Lake District fells, except in the Keswick neighbourhood,
where the story of St. Herbert gives us a hint that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
though the fell country might not be fully occupied, it was not
unexplored in the seventh century. The mention of the
murder of Alf and Alfwine, sons of King Alfwald, in 789 at
Wonwaldremere cannot be located at Windermere with any
certainty; but still it is possible that the Angles penetrated
to Coniston.</p>

<p>The Anglian settlements are known by their names&mdash;Pennington,
the <i>tun</i> of the Pennings in Furness; Workington,
the <i>tun</i> of the Weorcingas, and so on. Among the mountains
there is only one <i>ton</i>&mdash;Coniston, or as it was anciently spelt
Cuninges-tun, Koninges-ton. Conishead in Low Furness was
Cunninges-heved, the headland of the King, where perhaps
Ecgfrith or his successors had a customs-house to take toll of
the traders crossing the sands to the iron mines. So Cynings-tun
(the y pronounced like a French u, and making in later
English Cunnings-tun) might mean King's-town; in Norse,
Konungs-tun, whence we get the alternative pronunciations of
the modern spelling, Coniston or Cuniston. What the Norse
had to do with it we shall soon see.</p>

<p>Now it is unlikely that kings lived in so out-of-the-way a
place; but possible that they appropriated the copper mines.
The ancient claim of kings to all minerals is still kept in mind
by the word "royalty." And if the king's miners lived here
under his reeve or officer, their stockaded village would be
rightly known as Cynings-tun, the King's-town.</p>

<p>It is right to add that some antiquaries make the names
beginning with Coning-or Coni-to mean the Rabbits'-town,
Rabbits'-head, Rabbits'-garth, and so forth, and yet even in
Iceland, which was always republican, there is a Kongsbakki,
King's-bank, at which no king ever lived. In ancient times,
as now, sentiment counted for something in the naming of
places; and many names, otherwise without meaning, may
have been simply given by the settler in remembrance of his
old home. We cannot say for certain that Coniston was not
so called by an immigrant of the Viking Age, much later than
the invasion of the Angles; possibly he came from a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of similar name in Craven or Holderness or elsewhere and
brought the name with him.</p>

<p>The Welsh appear to have remained under Teutonic (or
later, Scandinavian) masters, and one relic of their tongue
seems to show how they were treated. They seem to have
been employed as shepherds, and they counted their flocks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Un, dau, tri, y pedwar, y pimp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chwech, y saith, y wyth, y nau, y dec;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Un-ar-dec, deu-ar-dec, tri-ar-dec, pedwar-ar-dec, pemthec;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Un-ar-pymthec, deu-ar-pymthec, tri-ar-pymthec, pedwar-ar-pymthec, ucent;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or in the ancient equivalent form of these Welsh numerals,
which their masters learned from them, and used ever after in
a garbled form as the right way to count sheep. The Coniston
count-out runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yan, taen, tedderte, medderte, pimp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sethera, lethera, hovera, dovera, dick;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yan-a-mimph, taen-a-mimph, tedder-a-mimph, medder-a-mimph, gigget.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And from these north-country dales the Anglo-Cymric score
has spread, with their roaming sons and daughters, pretty
nearly all the world over. (See the Rev. T. Ellwood's papers
on the subject in Cumb. and West. Antiq. Soc. <i>Transactions</i>,
vol. iii.)</p>

<p>During the ninth century the Anglian power declined.
Welsh Cumbria regained some measure of independence with
kings or kinglets of its own, under the dominant over-lordship
of the Scottish crown. But the Anglian settlers still held their
tuns, though their influence and interests so diminished that
it was impossible for them to continue and complete the
colonization of Lakeland. It remained a no-man's-land, a
debateable border country, hardly inhabited and quite
uncivilised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Norse Period.</span></h3>

<p>Who then settled the dales, cleared the forest, drained the
swamps, and made the wilderness into fields and farms?</p>

<p>Let us walk to-day through the valleys to the north of the
village, and ask by the way what the country can tell us of its
history.</p>

<p>Leaving the church we come in a few minutes to Yewdale
Beck. Why "beck?" Nobody here calls it "brook," as in
the Saxon south, nor "burn," as in the Anglian north. In the
twelfth century, as now, the name was "Ywedallbec," showing
that it had been named neither in Anglian nor in Saxon, but
by inhabitants who talked the language of the Vikings.</p>

<p>The house on the hill before us, above fields sloping to the
flats, is the Thwaite house. <i>Thveit</i> in Iceland, which the
Norsemen colonized, means a field sloping to a flat. On the
wooded hill behind it are enclosures called the high and low
Guards&mdash;"yard" would be the Saxon word; <i>gardhr</i> is the
Norse, becoming in our dialect sometimes "garth" and sometimes
"gard" or "guard."</p>

<p>At the Waterhead the signpost tells us to follow the road
to Hawkshead, anciently Hawkens-heved or Hawkenside&mdash;<i>Hauk's</i>
or <i>Hákon's</i> headland or seat.</p>

<p>Taking the second turn to the left we go up the ravine of
Tarn Hows Gill (<i>Tjarn-haugs-gil</i>), and reach a favourite spot
for mountain views. Above and around the moorland lake
rise the Langdale Pikes (<i>Langidalr</i> there is also in Iceland),
Lingmoor (<i>lyng-mor</i>), Silver How (<i>Sölva-haugr</i>), Loughrigg
(<i>loch-hryggr</i>), Fairfield (<i>fær-fjall</i>), Red Screes (<i>raud-skridhur</i>),
and on the left Weatherlam (<i>vedhr-hjalmr</i>) and all the <i>fells</i> and
<i>dales</i>, <i>moors</i> and <i>meres</i>, which cannot be named without talking
Norse.</p>

<p>Descending to the weir which was built by the late Mr.
Marshall, to throw into one the three Monk Coniston Tarns,
as the sheet of water is still called, a broken path leads us
down past the waterfall of Tom or Tarn Gill, romantically
renamed Glen Mary, and now even "St. Mary's Glen," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
out upon the road opposite Yewtree House, behind which
stood the famous old yew blown down in the storm of 22nd
December, 1894. Turning to the right, we pass Arnside
(<i>Arna-sidha</i> or <i>setr</i>, Ami's fellside or dairy) and Oxenfell
(<i>öxna-fell</i>), and soon look down upon Colwith (<i>Koll-vidhr</i>,
"peak-wood" from the peaked rocks rising to the left above
it; or <i>Kol-vidhr</i>, wood in which charcoal was made). We quit
the road to Skelwith (<i>skál-vidhr</i>, the wood of the scale or shed)
and descend to Colwith Feet (<i>fit</i>, meadow on the bank of a
river or lake), and ascend again to Colwith Force (<i>fors</i>,
waterfall), and pass the <i>Tarn to Fell Foot</i>, an old manor house,
bought in 1707 by Sir Daniel Fleming's youngest son Fletcher,
ancestor of the Flemings of Rayrigg, who placed his coat of
arms over the door (as Mr. George Browne of Troutbeck says&mdash;Cumb.
and West. Antiq. Soc. <i>Transactions</i>, vol. xi., p. 5).</p>

<p>Permission is readily given to view the terraced mound
behind the house, in which Dr. Gibson and Mr. H. S. Cowper
have recognized a Thingmount such as the Vikings used for
the ceremonies of their Thing or Parliament. There was one
in Dublin, the Thingmote; the Manx Tynwald is still in use;
and the name <i>Thingvöllr</i> (thing-field) survives at Thingwall in
Cheshire, South Lancashire, and Dumfriesshire. On the steps
of the mound the people stood in their various ranks while the
Law-speaker proclaimed from the top the laws or judgments
decreed by the Council. Eastward from the mount, to make
the site complete, a straight path should lead (as in the Isle of
Man) to a temple by a stream or well; and around should be
flat ground enough for the people to camp out, for they met at
midsummer and spent several days in passing laws, trying
suits, talking gossip, driving bargains, and holding games&mdash;as
if it were Grasmere Sports and Wakefield Competition, hiring
fair and cattle market, County Council and Assizes, all rolled
into one. These requirements are perfectly met by this site,
which is also in a conveniently central position, with Roman
roads and ancient paths leading to it in all directions through
Lakeland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>From other sources than place-names&mdash;from Norse words
in the present dialect as analysed by Mr. Ellwood, we learn
that the Vikings settled here as farmers. The words they
have handed down to their descendants are not fighting words,
but farming words&mdash;names of agricultural tools and usages,
and the homely objects of domestic life.</p>

<p>The Norse settlement appears, therefore, to be an immigration,
not of invaders, but of refugees; and the event which
first caused it was perhaps the raid of King Harald Fairhair,
about 880-890, on the Vikings of the Hebrides, Galloway, and
the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>Gradually they spread from the coast into the fells, until
they had filled all the hill country; and if we set down their
first arrival as about 890, we find that for no less than three
hundred years they were left in possession of the lands they
settled, and in enjoyment of liberty to make their own laws
and to rule their own commonwealth at the Thingmount on
which we are standing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Norman Period.</span></h3>

<p>The Norman Conquest, it must be understood, did not
touch the Lake District. William the Conqueror and his men
never entered Cumbria, nor even High Furness. The dales
are not surveyed in <i>Domesday</i>, and the few landowners mentioned
on the fringe of the fells are obviously of Norse or
Celtic origin&mdash;Duvan and Thorolf, and Ornulf and Orm,
Gospatric and Gillemichael. After William Rufus had seized
Carlisle, the territory of Cumbria and Westmorland was
granted to various lords; but the dales were the <i>hinterland</i> of
their claim. In the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> we have full accounts of the
inhabitants and proceedings of the lowlands during the twelfth
century, but not a word about the Lakeland. And in the
disturbed and disputed condition of affairs&mdash;the lordship was
even in the hands of the King of Scots from 1135 to 1157&mdash;it
is easy to understand that it was worth nobody's while to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
attempt the difficult task of reducing to servitude a body of
hardy freeholders, secure in their mountain fastnesses.</p>

<p>In the later part of the twelfth century, the baron of
Kendal and the abbot of Furness began to take steps towards
asserting their claim.</p>

<p>Thirty men, for the most part residents in the surrounding
lowlands and already retainers of the abbot and the baron,
were sworn in to survey the debateable ground. Half of these
men, to judge by their names or pedigrees, were of Viking
origin. In the list are Swein, Ravenkell, Frostolf, Siward
(Sigurd), Bernulf (Brynjolf), Ketel, and several Dolfins, Ulfs
and Orms, with the Irish Gospatrick and Gillemichael. Of
the other half, several are Anglo-Saxon and the rest Norman.</p>

<p>Their starting-point, in beating the boundaries, was Little
Langdale&mdash;as if they had met, by old use and wont of the
countryside, at the Thingmount; and they enclosed the
district by Brathay, Windermere, and Leven, eastward;
Wrynose and Duddon, westward; and then halved it by a
line, along which we may follow them, to Tilberthwaite and
by Yewdale Beck to Thurston Water. Thence their division
line ran along the shore of the lake to the Waterhead and
down the eastern side, and so along the Crake to Greenodd.</p>

<p>The western half was taken by the baron of Kendal to hold
of the abbot by paying a rent of 20s. yearly on the Vigil of the
Assumption (old Lammas Day). The baron also got right of
way and of hunting and hawking through the abbey's lands,
thence called Furness Fells. The valley of Coniston was
thus divided into two separate parts&mdash;the eastern side, but
including the Guards, was Monk Coniston; and the western
side, including also the lake, became known from the village
church as Church Coniston.</p>

<p>Though this arrangement was proposed about 1160, it was
not finally settled until 1196; after which the two owners could
proceed to reduce the old Norse freeholders to the condition
of feudal tenants. A charter of John, afterwards king, at the
end of the twelfth century, directs the removal of all tenants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in Furness Fells who have not rendered due fealty to the
abbot. By what threats or promises or actual violence this
was accomplished we have no record; but we can see that it
was a slow process, and we can infer that it was not done by
way of extermination. For the Norse families, with their
language and customs, remained in Coniston. They were a
canny race, and knew how to adapt themselves to circumstances.
Throughout Lakeland they evidently made good
terms with the Norman lords, and kept a degree of independence
which was afterwards explained away as the border
tenant-right&mdash;but really must have been in its origin nothing
less than a compromise between nominal feudalism and a
proud reminiscence of their Norse allodial practice&mdash;the free
ownership of the soil they had taken, and reclaimed, and
inhabited for three centuries of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h2>V.&mdash;MONK CONISTON.</h2>

<p>The Furness monks were of the Cistercian order; which
is to say, they were farmers rather than scholars or
mere recluses and devotees. To understand them in
the days of their power, we must put aside all the vulgar
nonsense about fat friars or visionary fakirs, and see them as
a company of shareholders or college of gentlemen from the
best landowning families, whose object in their association
was, of course, the service of God in their abbey church; but,
outside of it, the development of agriculture and industries.
They devoted their property and their lives to the work,
getting nothing in return except mere board and lodging, and&mdash;for
interest on their capital&mdash;the means of grace and the
hope of glory.</p>

<p>Some of the brothers lived continually at the abbey, fully
occupied in the service of the household, in hospitality to the
poor and to travellers, in teaching the school, in various arts
and crafts, and especially in the office work necessary for the
management of their estates. Their method was to acquire
land, sometimes by purchase or exchange, more often by gift
from those who had entered the community, or had received
services from them; and then to improve these lands, which
were generally of the poorest when they came into the abbey's
possession. As the plots were widely scattered over Lancashire,
Yorkshire, and Cumberland, it must have been no light
labour to manage them. For this purpose a brother was sent
to act as steward or bailiff at a grange or cell on the outlying
estate.</p>

<p>One such manor house of the monks we may see at Hawkshead
Old Hall (see the sixpenny <i>Guide to Hawkshead</i>, by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
H. S. Cowper). This was built more than two centuries later
than the division of High Furness; and though there was
probably an earlier building, the list of abbey possessions in
1292 makes no mention of it. The monks, energetic as they
were, had plenty to do in improving their lands in Low
Furness, and made little impression at first upon the wild
woods and moors of the fells, thinly dotted with the old Norse
thwaites and steads.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they provided almost immediately for
the spiritual needs of their new flock. There was already a
chapel at Hawkshead, which is mentioned in 1200, but no
consecrated burial ground; and if anyone wished for Christian
burial, his body had to be carried on horseback or on a sledge
some twenty miles to Dalton. In 1219 the monks amended
this by making Hawkshead Chapel into a parish church,
greatly against the will of the vicar of Dalton, who was the
loser by the reform; and Monk Coniston has ever since been
in the ecclesiastical parish of Hawkshead.</p>

<p>Church Coniston got no share in this advantage. Up to
the time of Elizabeth, its people had to take their dead to
Ulverston. As you go through the village, just beyond the
Baptist Chapel, is a stream known as Jenkin Syke; and the
story goes than a Jenkins of Yewdale or Tilberthwaite was
being carried, uncoffined, on a sledge to Dalton or Ulverston
for burial, but when the procession reached Torver they found
that the body was gone. They tried back, and discovered it
in the beck, which bears the name to this day.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious use of the fells to the monks
was as a forest of unlimited timber. One purpose for which
they wanted this was for charcoal to smelt the iron ore of the
mines in Low Furness. They needed the waterway of the
lake, which was the baron's, who, in 1240, allowed them to
have "one boat competent to carry what might be necessary
upon the lake of Thurstainwater, and another moderate sized
boat for fishing in it, at their will, with 20 nets," and a similar
privilege on Windermere. The baron bargained that if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of the monks' men damaged his property it should be "reasonably
amended"&mdash;as much as to say there was really nothing
of value along the western side of our lake in 1240.</p>

<p>Now that the monks had the waterway and could get at
their forests, they pushed the industry. By the end of the
century (1292) they could return a considerable income from
their ironworks, while making nothing out of the agriculture
of High Furness.</p>

<p>There was good hunting, however, and in 1281 the abbot
got free warren in Haukesheved, Satirthwait, Grisedale,
Neburthwaite, (Monk) Kunyngeston, and other parts of the
fells&mdash;the old Norse names alone are mentioned. But in 1338
he was allowed by Government to impark woods in Fournes fells;
not to create deer parks in a cultivated country, for
that was not done until much later, when the bad Abbot
Banks in 1516 "of the tenements of Richard Myellner and
others at a place called Gryesdale in Furness fells made
another park" (beside those he had just made in Low Furness)
"to put deer into, which park is about five miles in compass"
(<i>Pleadings and Depositions</i>, Duchy of Lancaster, quoted
by Dr. T. K. Fell; Mr. H. S. Cowper supposes this site to
have been Dale Park.) These fourteenth century parks or
parrocks were simply enclosures from the wild woods, and
among them were Waterpark, Parkamoor, and Lawson Park
which we have passed. So it was a century and a half before
the monks got their woods cleared enough to settle their
shepherds on the lands given them by the thirty sworn men's
division.</p>

<p>Even then it was notoriously a wild place. In 1346 (as we
gather from a ballad and pedigrees printed in Whitaker's
<i>Loidis and Elmete</i>, 1816, vol. ii., p. 396) it was, like Sherwood
and Inglewood, the resort of outlaws. Adam of Beaumont
(near Leeds) with his brother, and Will Lockwood, Lacy,
Dawson and Haigh, came hither after slaying Sir John Elland
in revenge for the murder of Sir Robert Beaumont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Furness Fells long time they were<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>They seem to have been here until 1363 or later&mdash;a gang of
brigands; which shows how little grip the abbey had so far
laid upon its <i>hinterland</i>.</p>

<p>But gradually new farms were created and held by native
families who acknowledged the abbot as their lord, and provided
men for military duty or for various "boons," such as a
day's work in harvest. These new farms are now known as
"grounds." In Monk Coniston we find Rawlinson, Atkinson,
Knipe, Bank, and Holme Grounds; and in the list of abbey
"tenants" of 1532, "from the Ravenstie upwards" (the path
from Dale Park by Ravencrag to Hawkshead), are Robert
Atkyns, Robert Knype, Robert Bank, Rainold and Robert
Holme. The Kirkbys of the Thwaite and the Pennys of
Penny House also signed. Rawlinson is not on this list, but
on that of 1509 giving the "tenants" "from the Ravenstie
downwards," <i>i. e</i>., south part of High Furness. The lists do
not state that, for example, the Bankes lived at Bank Ground,
but prove that the families were then in the immediate
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>At Bank Ground are the ruins of a house which was of
some pretentions, judging from carved stones lying there.
Local tradition makes it the site of a religious house, with a
healing well. Dr. Gibson supplies a monk, "Father Brian,"
and tells a tradition of a witch living opposite (where the
gondola station is) who came to the monk and confessed that
she had sold herself to the devil. The monk set her a penance,
and promised absolution. So when the devil came to
claim his own she fled up Yewdale Beck, calling on "Father
Brian and St. Herbert," and the devil's hoof stuck fast in the
Bannockstone, a rock below the wooden bridge in Mr. George
Fleming's field. The hole is there. Many rocks have such
holes, from the weathering out of nodules. Mediævals may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
have called them devil's footprints; moderns often call them
"cup-markings," in equal error.</p>

<p>It may be that a hermit lived where the Bankes afterwards
built their homestead; it is possible that there was a "cell"
for the abbey's Monk Coniston representative at the Waterhead.
But the final list of abbey estates (1535), while mentioning
Watsyde Parke, Lawson Parke, and Parkamore
among granges and parks, puts "Watterhed et (Monk)
Connyngston, £10-19-5-1/4" in the rental of tenants, as if the
farm were then let to a tenant, as Hawkshead Hall was in
1512. The old Waterhead mansion, however, is known as
Monk Coniston <i>par excellence</i>, and behind the modern Gothic
front are ancient rooms with thick walls and massive beams,
said by Mr. Marshall, the owner, to be part of the original
monks' house.</p>

<p>There are few actual relics of this period in the way of
archæological finds, so that the discovery of a tiny key of
lead, with trefles on the ring, cast in a double mould, at Tent
Cottage, where it was found under a stone, is worth remark.
Mr. H. S. Cowper thought it a pilgrim's badge of the fourteenth
or fifteenth century, and the site was one of the
"grounds" of the abbey "tenants."</p>

<p>The list of "tenants" referred to is in an agreement of 1532
to prevent "improvement." They had "inclosed common
pasture more largelie than they ought to doe, under the colour
of one bargaine called Bounding of the pasture," and this sort
of "improvement" was thenceforth forbidden. But five years
later the abbey was dissolved, to the great harm and regret of
the country side. Though a bad abbot did, for a time, give
trouble by making deer parks, the abbey rule, on the whole,
was good. Monk Coniston made slow but sure progress, and
reached a point beyond which it did not advance for the next
three hundred years.</p>

<p>What it was like when the abbey gave it up may be gathered
from the report of Henry VIII.'s commissioners:&mdash;"There is
moche wood growing in Furneysfelles in the mounteynes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
there, as Byrk, Holey, Asshe, Ellers, Lyng, lytell short Okes,
and other Undrewood, but no Tymber of any valewe;" they
mention also "Hasells." That there <i>had</i> been timber is
proved by the massive oak beams of many a farmhouse and
old hall, but the forests were all by this time cleared, and
coppice had taken their place. "There is another yerely
profytte comming and growing of the said woods, called
Grenehewe, Bastyng, Bleching, bynding, making of Sadeltrees,
Cartwheles, cuppes, disshes, and many other thynges wrought
by Cowpers and Turners" (the beginning of well-known local
industries) "with making of Coles (charcoal) and pannage of
Hoggs."</p>

<p>After the dissolution the manor remained in the Crown
until 1662, when Charles II. granted it to General Monk,
Duke of Albemarle, whose descendant Elizabeth, daughter of
George, Duke of Montague (whence the other name of Peel
Island), married Henry, third Duke of Buccleugh, whose
representative is now lord of the manor.</p>

<p>Monk Coniston remained separate from Church Coniston,
both ecclesiastically and politically, until the Local Government
Act of 1894 establishing Parish Councils gave occasion
for the union of the two shores of the lake into one civil
parish. But Monk Coniston is still in the ecclesiastical parish
of Hawkshead.</p>

<h2>VI.&mdash;THE FLEMINGS OF CONISTON HALL.</h2>

<p>In 1196 the baron of Kendal was Gilbert fitz Roger fitz
Reinfrid, who had got his lordship by marriage with
Heloise, granddaughter of William I. de Lancaster. In
her right he claimed Furness as well. So did the abbey, and
the result of this dispute we have seen in the division of the
fells.</p>

<p>There was a family at Urswick who, to judge by their name,
might have been descendants of the old Norse settlers. Adam
fitz Bernulf held land there of Sir Michael le Fleming about
1150; Orm fitz Bernulf was one of the thirty sworn men;
Stephen of Urswick was another. Stephen was doubtless
christened after the king, who had founded the abbey; for
fashions in names followed royalty then as now. Gilbert fitz
Bernulf was another of the family&mdash;a Normanised Norseman,
it would seem. To him Coniston was let or assigned by
Baron Gilbert of Kendal.</p>

<p>His son Adam was living in 1227. Adam's daughter
Elizabeth was his heiress, and married Sir Richard le
Fleming.</p>

<p>Le Fleming, or <i>the</i> Fleming, meant simply "the man from
Flanders." William Rufus had invited many Flemings to
settle as "buffer" colonies in Cumberland and Wales, and Sir
Richard's ancestor Michael had received Aldingham in Low
Furness. Sir Richard's grandfather, being a younger son, had
got a Cumbrian estate with headquarters at a place called by
the Cumbrian-Welsh Caernarvon. <i>Ar mhon</i> (arfon) means
"over against Mona;" in Wales <i>Caer-n-arfon</i> is "the castle
over against Anglesey (Mona);" in Cumbria the same name
had been given to the castle over against Man (Mona). It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
was an oblong base-court with a ditch, and a round artificial
hill (later known as Coney-garth or King's-garth, cop) exactly
like the Mote at Aldingham. There Sir Richard's father lived,
and dying was buried at Calder Abbey.</p>

<p>But when Sir Richard married Elizabeth of Urswick, and
got with her the manors of Urswick, Coniston, Carnforth, and
Claughton, they chose to live at Coniston; and being wealthy,
they probably built a mansion which, rebuilt two hundred
years later, became the Coniston Hall we now see. Their
settlement here would be about 1250 or later.</p>

<p>Sir Richard, being a knight, must have brought his men
with him, and let them have farms near at hand on condition
of following him to the wars. No doubt he turned out the
Norse holders of Heathwaite and Bleathwaite, Little Arrow
(Ayrey, "moor") and Yewdale, or took on them as his men.
Billmen and bowmen he would need, and we find a Bowmanstead
in the village.</p>

<p>These tenants followed his son, Sir John, to Scotland in
1299 to fight Wallace; and got, with him, special protection
and privileges from Edward I. for bravery at the siege of
Caerlaverock. John's son, Sir Rayner, was in favour at
Court, and held the office of King's Steward, <i>Dapifer</i>, for
these parts, in the beginning of the fourteenth century. So
West says.</p>

<p>His son, Sir John, had three children. The daughter Joan
married John le Towers of Lowick; his eldest son William
died without children; and so Coniston Hall fell to the
younger brother, Sir John, who lived there in Edward III.'s
time, while Adam of Beaumont and his fellows were outlaws
in the fells, and doubtless shot the Coniston deer. Sir John
died in 1353, and was succeeded by Sir Richard, who married
Catharine of Kirkby, and died about 1392. Of his three sons,
Sir Thomas, the eldest, succeeded him. He married (1371)
Margaret of Bardsey, then Elayn Laybourn (1390), and then
his deceased wife's sister Isabel (1396). His elder son was
Thomas, for whom in his childhood his father arranged a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
marriage with an heiress, Isabel de Lancaster. She brought
Rydal into the family.</p>

<p>Up to this time the knights "le Fleming" had lived for 150
years at old Coniston Hall; during Sir Thomas' life (he died
about 1481) the Hall seems to have been rebuilt, so far as can
be gathered from the architecture of the remains. Part of his
time he spent at Rydal, perhaps while rebuilding Coniston
Hall.</p>

<p>After him there are no more knights "le Fleming," but a
series of Squires Fleming, keeping up both the Coniston and
Rydal Halls.</p>

<p>Squire John, son of Sir Thomas, was a retainer of the lord
of Greystoke, a fighting man in the wars of the Roses. He
married Joan Broughton, and his son John in 1484-5 moved
to Rydal, leaving Coniston Hall as dower-house for his stepmother
Anne. He died about 1532. His son Hugh lived at
Coniston, and married Jane Huddleston of Millom Castle. He
died in 1557, and his son Anthony died young; and so his
grandson William succeeded him in the last year of Queen
Mary.</p>

<p>West says:&mdash;"This William Fleming resided at Coniston
Hall, which he enlarged and repaired, as some of the carving,
bearing the date and initial letters of his and his lady's name,
plainly shows; he died about 40 Elizabeth (1598), and was
buried in Grasmere Church. The said William Fleming was
a gentleman of great pomp and expence, by which he injured
an opulent fortune; but his widow Agnes (a Bindloss of
Borwick) surviving him about 33 years, and being a lady of
extraordinary spirit and conduct, so much improved and
advanced her family affairs, that she not only provided for,
and married well, all her daughters, but also repurchased
many things that had been sold off.... This Agnes
established a younger branch of the family in the person of
Daniel, her then second son. When her son John married
and resided at Coniston Hall, she retired to Rydal Hall, where
she died 16 August, 7 Car. I. (1641)."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a tradition that Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586)
visited at Coniston Hall. There used to be an old book with
his name in it and "Fulke Greville is a good boy" scribbled
in an antique hand on a fly-leaf. It is probable that Squire
William, the "gentleman of great pomp," invited many
visitors, especially young men of distinction, for hunting
parties in his deer park; and Sidney is said to have stayed at
Brougham Castle, so that he may well have been, once in a
while, in the Lake District.</p>

<p>Dr. Gibson tells a legend, which he says he collected at
Coniston, of Girt Will o' t' Tarns&mdash;"one of the Troutbeck
giants." (Hugh Hird, the chief of them, flourished in this
period.) Girt Will is represented as carrying off "the Lady
Eva's" bowermaiden, and being caught and killed at Caldron
Dub on Yewdale Beck (a little above the sawmills), where his
grave was shown, still haunted, they said. There is no "Lady
Eva" in the records, but (allowing for distortion) there may
be a grain of truth in the story, if it really was a tradition.</p>

<p>Squire John lived at Coniston. He was twenty-three at his
father's death. His first wife was Alice Duckett of Grayrigg
(died 1617); his second, the widow of Sir Thomas Bold, and
daughter of Sir William Norris of Speke, the famous old
timbered hall near Liverpool. She died at Coniston Hall,
and was buried in Coniston Church, which Squire William
had built. His third was Dorothy Strickland of Sizergh, for
whose sake he became a Roman Catholic at a time when
Roman Catholics were persecuted; and consequently, after
being J.P. and High Sheriff, he was heavily fined, and had to
get a special licence to travel five miles from home. He had
a turn for literature; we find in the Rydal letters one enclosing
the latest playbook and (Massinger's new work) the <i>Virgin
Martir</i>.</p>

<p>His son William was only fourteen at his father's death in
1643, and soon afterwards died of smallpox in London. Consequently
the Hall went to his cousin William (son of the
Daniel before mentioned), born there in 1610, and educated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
St. John's College, Cambridge. He was one of Charles I.'s
cavaliers, and suffered severely in pocket for his loyalty. He
married Alice Kirkby in 1632, and died at the hall in 1653.</p>

<p>His eldest son Daniel, born in 1633, studied at Queen's
College, Oxford, and Gray's Inn. He married, in 1655,
Barbara Fletcher of Hutton (who died 1670), and they had a
large family. He was a cavalier, heavily fined by Cromwell's
sequestrators, and living in retirement until the Restoration,
busied in improving his estates and his mind. He became a
famous scholar and antiquary, corresponding with many
learned men, and distinguished, among other things, for his
knowledge of Runic inscriptions. Under Charles II. he took
a very active share in public business; was knighted at
Windsor in 1681, and elected M.P. for Cockermouth, 1685.
He died 1701.</p>

<p>This Sir Daniel finally forsook Coniston for Rydal. In his
lifetime the Hall was held by his bachelor brothers, Roger and
William, lieut.-colonel of cavalry and D.L. for Lancashire. In
the Rydal MSS. there are many letters to and from them; for
instance, Major W. Fleming writes (July 1st, 1674) to the
constables of Coniston about arming the men of Colonel
Kirkby's regiment&mdash;the pikemen to have an ashen pike not
under sixteen feet in length, the musketeers to have a well-fixed
"musquet" with a barrel not under three feet in length,
and a bore for twelve bullets to the pound, with "collar of
bandeleers" and a good sword and belt.</p>

<p>Other relatives of the family lived at the Hall, which was
kept up as a sort of general establishment. In September,
1680, Sir Daniel notes that his bachelor uncle, John Kirkby,
"did fall sick Sept. 15, and he died at Coniston Hall, Sept. 28.
I had not the happ to see him dureing his sickness." But Sir
Daniel was sometimes there, and speaking of one visit, he
says (December 14th, 1680), "my tenants there and I did see
a blazing starr with a very long tail&mdash;reaching almost to the
middle of the sky from the place of the sun setting&mdash;a little
after the sun setting, near the place where the sun did set.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Lord, have mercy upon us, pardon all our sins, and bless the
King and these Kingdomes." He got over it by Christmas,
and "paid the Applethwait players for acting here, Dec. 27th
00-05-00" (5s).</p>

<p>On February 26th, 1681, his mother died at Coniston Hall,
and was buried in Lady Bold's grave, close by her brother,
John Kirkby&mdash;"Mr. John Braithwait preaching her funeral
sermon upon 1 Tim. 5, 9, and 10, and applying it very well to
her." Her three sons put up the brass in the church to her
memory.</p>

<p>There was no intention then of letting the Hall go to ruin.
Sir Daniel notes (March 20th, 1688), "This day was laid the
foundation of the great barn at Coniston Hall"&mdash;not the new
barn to the south of it, which is a much later building.</p>

<p>We get a glimpse of the friendly relations of hall and village
in a letter of November 16th, 1689, from George Holmes at
Strabane to the colonel at the Hall, describing the famous
siege of Derry, and adding&mdash;"Pray do me the favour to
present my humble service to Mr. Rodger and all the good
familie, to the everlasting constable, and to my noble friend
the vitlar."</p>

<p>Dr. Gibson, about 1845, was told by an aged inhabitant of
Haws Bank that one of the cottages in that hamlet (pulled
down to build Mr. John Bell's house) was formerly an alehouse,
and that a neighbour who died at a great age when
the doctor's informant was a boy, used to relate that he
remembered having seen two brothers of the Fleming family,
who were staying at the Hall, go there for ale, and make a
scramble with their change amongst the children round the
door, of whom the relater was one. The names of the
brothers, he stated, were "Major and Roger."</p>

<p>This must have been in Queen Anne's days, when perhaps
Colonel William and his brother Roger were gone. But of
Sir Daniel's sons, one was Major Michael, M.P. for Westmorland
in 1706, died before George I. (his daughter married
Michael Knott, Esq., of Rydal, whose family afterwards came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to Coniston Waterhead); and another was Roger, afterwards
vicar of Brigham.</p>

<p>So we bring "the good familie" at the Hall down to the
second decade of the eighteenth century, after which they
seem to have deserted Coniston and left it to decay. Fifty
years later it was an ivy-covered ruin.</p>

<p>A novel by the Rev. W. Gresley, M.A., Prebendary of
Lichfield, called <i>Coniston Hall: or, The Jacobites</i> (1846), professes
to recount the fortunes of "Sir Charles Dalton" of the
hall, in the rising of 1715. But the local colour is inaccurate,
and the circumstances impossible.</p>

<p>About 1815 it was patched up into a farmhouse; the ruined
wing was left to the ivy, and an inclined way was built up to
the old oriel window of the dining-hall to make it into a barn.
Later, the old oak was carried off. Quite recently the
dwelling-house and the chimneys have been newly cemented,
which, necessary as it was, takes away from the picturesqueness.
The main features of the interior can be traced; we
can make out the daïs, the great fireplace, the carved screen
through which doors led to the stairs going down to buttery
and kitchen, and the fine old roof with its great oak beams.
From the middle beam, in which the grooves for planking are
still seen, a wainscot partition was fixed to the back of the
daïs, and behind it was the withdrawing room. There you see
its large fireplace and windows on both sides, and in the
corner is a spiral staircase, leading down to a door opening on
the garden, and up to the loft or solar, in mediæval times
the best bedroom, of which we can see the footing of the
flooring joists up in the wall, and the little window looking
east to catch the morning sun. That was no drawback; folk
were early risers when they had only candles to sit up by.</p>

<p>In its old state the Hall must have been a fine place on a
fine site; damp, it might be thought, but you note that its
dwelling rooms are not on the ground floor, and in those big
fireplaces you can imagine the roaring fires that were kept
when wood was plentiful. The lake is close at hand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fishing, and along the shore towards Torver extended the
deer park, still a lovely bit of park scenery. That they kept
deer even after the head of the family had settled at Rydal,
Sir Daniel's accounts testify. On December 22nd, 1659, he
notes, "given unto George Fleming's boy for bringing a doe
from Coniston, 2s.;" and on Christmas Day, "given unto
Thomas Brockbanck for killing the doe at Coniston, 1s. 6d."
It was not only at Christmas that they indulged in venison.
On July 11th, 1660 (King Charles had just come home, so
cavaliers could feast), George Fleming brought two deer from
Coniston to Rydal, and got 2s.; and on September 11th, 1661,
Sir Daniel treated his brother-in-law, Sir George Fletcher, to
a hunt, and gave the tenants 1s. for drinks, "and next day
more for the hunters to drink, 2s. 6d." It sounds little, but
money was more valuable then, and he did not always kill a
deer so cheaply. On July 27th, 1672, "paid my brother
Roger which had spent in killing the buck at Coniston,
6s. 6d.;" and August 12th, 1677, "delivered to my son
William when he went to Coniston to kill a buck, 5s."</p>

<p>The following useful bit of topography is taken from the old
copy kindly lent by Dr. Kendall:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The ancient bounds of the manor of Coniston, besides the
Water or Lake of Coniston, and certain tenements in Torver,

<h2>VII.&mdash;THE CHURCH AND PUBLIC
BUILDINGS.</h2>

<p>There was probably no church at Coniston before the
time of Queen Elizabeth, though services may have
been held by the squire's chaplain. Monk Coniston
was, and still is ecclesiastically, in the parish of Hawkshead.</p>

<p>Coniston Church was built in 1586 by William Fleming,
the "gentleman of great pomp and expence." It was consecrated
and made parochial by Bishop Chaderton; the original
dedication is not known. In 1650 the Parliamentary enquiry
shows that there was no maintenance but the £1 19s. 10d.
which the people raised for their "reader," Sir Richard Roule&mdash;"Sir"
meaning "Rev." in those days. With liberal squires
at the Hall, no doubt the "priest," as they called him, was not
badly off, though Colonel Fleming, writing to his brother
(November 27th, 1688), says:&mdash;"Tell the constable the same
hearth man (hearth-tax collector) is coming again. Tell him
to be as kind as his conscience will permit to his neighbours,
and play the fool no more. The priest and he doth not know
how happy they are." The income was eked out by the old
custom of "whittlegate," right to have his meals at various
houses in turn; and it is said that the Priest Stile opposite
Mount Cottage was so called because he was so often seen
crossing it on the way to his accustomed seat at the squire's
table.</p>

<p>Until the end of the eighteenth century the curate was also
schoolmaster, and as late as 1761 was nominated to the dual
office by the six men or sidesmen representing the inhabitants.
The patronage was afterwards in the hands of the Braddylls
of Conishead Priory; eventually it passed into the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the Rev. A. Peache, and the living is now in the gift of the
Peache trustees. Its net value is £220.</p>

<p>The original church, for we do not know that it was rebuilt
between 1586 and 1818, was a small oblong structure with
lattice windows and a western belfry tower.</p>

<p>In the Coniston Museum there is a mutilated document
(found by Mr. Herbert Bownass among some old deeds) which
not only shows the quaint arrangement of seats in the church
separating the sexes, but also gives what is practically a
directory of the parish in the time of Charles II.</p>

<p>In 1817 the curate in charge, John Douglas, and the churchwardens,
Joseph Barrow and William Townson, obtained a
faculty to rebuild the church. A sum of £325 was raised by
subscription, a further sum by assessment, and the Incorporated
Church Building Society made a grant of £125. The
new church was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on
November 20th, 1819&mdash;Coniston being still within the diocese
of Chester, not yet transferred to that of Carlisle.</p>

<p>In 1835 a faculty of confirmation was issued from the Consistory
Court of Chester by which pews were assigned to the
contributors of the building fund and other parishioners. In
1849, Dr. Gibson described the building as "oblong and barn-like,
with a few blunt-arched windows in its dirty yellow walls,
and overtopped at its western extremity by an unsightly black
superstructure of rough stone, which some might call a small
square tower badly proportioned, and others, with apparently
equal correctness, the stump of a large square chimney."</p>

<p>In 1866 the same writer, in a paper read to the Historic
Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, said:&mdash;"The church of
Coniston, which occupies a position central to the village, is a
chapel of ease under Ulverston, with a stipend of £146,
recently augmented, derived from land, houses, bounty,
dividends and fees. It was rebuilt in 1819 on the site of an
older edifice. The only part of the former church that remains
is the belfry tower, which, being out of keeping and small in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
proportion to the body of the present building, confers but
little ecclesiastical and no architectural distinction upon it."</p>

<p>The late Mr. Roger Bownass, in marginal pencillings on this
paper, noted:&mdash;"This is an error. The Belfry Tower was
wholly rebuilt at the same time as the church, i.e., in 1818-19;
the writer of this note having seen the old Tower pulled down,
and new Foundations laid; One reason for the Landowners
rebuilding the Church (which they did chiefly at their own
expense) being the alleged state of the old Tower, the Bells of
which, the Sexton pretended he durst not ring for fear he
should bring the Tower down about his ears, though it was so
difficult to get it down. So strongly was it built and cemented
together that it had to be cut through nearly, near its base,
before it could be brought down." Mr. Bownass goes on to
say that his father, as one of the guarantees, contributed
nearly £50, "which his widow had to pay, he himself dying
before it was finished, and was the first person carried into
the Church while the shavings, etc., lay on the floor, as the
writer, his son, of 6 years of age, can well remember."</p>

<p>To resume Dr. Gibson's account:&mdash;"The new building is
plain even to meanness; but being now well screened by trees
and flourishing evergreens&mdash;and I may state that evergreens
grow here with a luxuriance that I have not seen elsewhere&mdash;it
is not so offensive to the eye as formerly. The interior has
been greatly beautified by improvements made in 1857, the
cost being defrayed by subscription. The addition of a
reading desk, pulpit, reredos and altar rail in handsomely
carved oak, the painting of what used to be an unsightly
expanse of white ceiling, in imitation of oak panelling, and
the spare but tasteful introduction of tinted glass into the
windows, have made the inside as handsome as it is likely to
be whilst the pews are allowed to remain. The parish register
dates back to 1594. In the vestry is stored a library, chiefly
of works in divinity, sermons, etc., which have been purchased
from time to time with the interest of different sums left by
the Fleming family, commencing with £5 under the will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Roger Fleming of Coniston, dated February, 1699. In the
vestibule of the southern entrance to the church is kept
one of those curious old chests, made from a solid block
of oak, like that containing the muniments of the Grammar
School at Hawkshead. The only contents of this are a
number of slips of paper, each bearing the almost illegible
affidavit of two women that the corpse of each person interred
was shrouded in cloth only made of woollen material. These
worn and fragile evidences of a curious old protective law&mdash;for
I infer it could only be enacted to support the landed
interest&mdash;serve, if they do nothing else, to explain the line in
Pope which has puzzled many modern readers&mdash;</p>

<p>So far Dr. Gibson on the "new" church, now the "old"
church, and already of the past.</p>

<p>On November 17th, 1891, the church was reopened by
Bishop Goodwin after a "restoration" which almost amounted
to renovation. The Rev. C. Chapman, in his pamphlet on
<i>The ancient Parochial Church of Coniston</i>, 1888, had already
been able to announce that £600 had been gathered for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Building Fund, beside about the same amount spent in buying
the old schoolhouse and playground in order to improve the
site. But the money did not suffice for entire rebuilding; the
ceiling and pews were removed, a chancel and vestry added,
a clock placed in the tower, the roughcast of the exterior was
cleared away, and stained glass windows have since been
inserted, of which the best is the little west window by Kempe
to the memory of the Beevers of the Thwaite. But few objects
of antiquarian interest remain. The old oak chest with a
curious padlock, the parish registers beginning 1594 and
recommencing 1695, the old library, and the little brass on the
south wall are all that is left to record the ancient family
of the Hall. The brass is inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>The churchyard is first mentioned as a burying ground in
1594, and until 1841 was very small: indeed, the population
it had to serve was small up to the nineteenth century. But
by 1841 the population of the parish had grown, and Lady le
Fleming made an addition to the churchyard. Subsequent
additions were made in 1845, 1865, and 1878, the last by the
removal of the old Institute, formerly the Boys' School. This
used to stand between the church and the road, as shown in
the photograph exhibited, with other views and relics of the
neighbourhood, in the museum at the Coniston Institute.</p>

<p>In Coniston Churchyard the centre of general interest is
Ruskin's grave, marked by the tall sculptured cross of gray
Tilberthwaite stone, which stands under the fir trees near
the wall separating the churchyard from the schoolyard.
Near it are the white crosses of the Beevers, and the
railed-in space is reserved for the family of Brantwood. The
sculptures on the east face are intended to suggest Ruskin's
earlier writings&mdash;the lower panel his juvenile poems; above,
the young artist with a hint of sunrise over Mont Blanc in the
background, for "Modern Painters;" the Lion of St. Mark,
for "Stones of Venice," and the candlestick of the Tabernacle
for "Seven Lamps." On the west face below is the parable
of the labourers in the vineyard&mdash;"Unto this Last," then
"Sesame and Lilies," the Angel of Fate with club, key and
nail for "Fors Clavigera," the "Crown of Wild Olive," and St.
George, symbolizing his later work. On the south edge are
the Squirrel, the Robin and the Kingfisher in a scroll of wild
rose to suggest Ruskin's favourite studies in natural history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
On the north edge is a simple interlaced plait. The cross was
carved by the late H. T. Miles of Ulverston from designs by
W. G. Collingwood.</p>

<p>The school used to be held in the church, an arrangement
common in this district when the clergyman was also schoolmaster.
Later, a small building was put up, within the area
of the present churchyard; this was turned into a Mechanics'
Institute in 1854, as already noted, when new schools were
built. The site of the Boys' School and master's house, with
adjacent ground, was conveyed by a deed dated December
6th, 1853, from Lady Le Fleming to the incumbent and chapel-wardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of Coniston and their successors. The buildings
were to be erected as approved by Lady Le Fleming, and the
school was always to be conducted on the principles of the
Established Church of England. There is no deed extant for
the Girls' (now the Infants') School. It was probably built at
the same time as the old Boys' School, being similar in construction,
especially in the chimneys (as Mr. Herbert Bownass
notes). Dr. Gibson says in <i>The Old Man</i> (1849) that both
schools had been conducted for the previous three or four
years on the Home and Colonial School system.</p>

<p>The schoolmasters since the building of the new schools
have been:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Diddams, 1854-1858.<br />
Mr. Ryder, 1858-1859.<br />
S. K. Thompson, 1859-1864.<br />
W. Brocklebank, 1864-1887.<br />
C. J. Fox, 1887-1891.<br />
John Morris, 1891-1902.<br />
W. J. Rich, 1902.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mistress of the Infants' School since 1876 has been Miss
Agnes Walker.</p>

<p>The Mechanics' Institute in 1877 was found to be inadequate
and inconvenient, and in 1878 a new building was made on
the Yewdale road. This in its turn was outgrown, and in
1896 the committee, under the presidency of Dr. Kendall,
resolved to enlarge it. A library and reading room, billiard
and recreation rooms, room for meetings and classes, bath,
museum, concert hall and caretaker's house were planned, and
built in 1897 with the proceeds of various exhibitions and
bazaars, added to private subscriptions. This enlarged
Institute or village clubhouse was opened by Mrs. Arthur
Severn on April 15th, 1896.</p>

<p>In 1900 an exhibition of drawings by the late Prof. Ruskin
was held, and visited by over 10,000 people. From the proceeds
of this a room for a museum was added, to supersede
the little room formerly allotted for the purpose; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Ruskin Museum was opened in August, 1901, Canon Rawnsley
giving the inaugural address. The collection shown in the
Museum is confined under two headings&mdash;"Ruskin" and
"Coniston." It comprises (<i>a</i>) local history and antiquities,
with a few illustrative specimens of general antiquities; (<i>b</i>)
local minerals, to which it is hoped some day to add other
branches of the natural history of Coniston: of this division
Mr. Ruskin laid the foundation by his gift in 1884 of a
collection of minerals and the model of the neighbourhood;
(<i>c</i>) Ruskin drawings and relics, given or lent by Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Severn; (<i>d</i>) books by and about Ruskin, with autographs,
etc., in illustration; (<i>e</i>) engravings after Ruskin's
drawings, and portraits of him; (<i>f</i>) copies and prints from
pictures which have formed the subject of his writing. The
collection is still growing, and an enlarged edition of the
Catalogue (3d.) was brought out at Easter, 1906; copies can
be had of the caretaker at the Institute. The Museum is
open every week-day from 10 till dusk, admission one penny
in the slot of the turnstile. Eight to ten thousand pennies
have been taken yearly since the opening. The hon. curator
is Mr. Herbert Bownass.</p>

<p>In the summer an exhibition, usually of pictures, is held
during August and September in the large hall adjoining.
Since the new Museum was built, the room formerly occupied
by the collections has been used as a Ladies' Reading Room;
and in 1905 a workshop for wood carving and other art crafts
was added to the premises. The subscription to the Institute
for residents over 16 years of age is 1s. 3d. a quarter; for
boys, 9d.; for visitors 1s. a week, or 2s. 6d. a month. The
management is in the hands of a committee elected by the
members, non-sectarian and non-political; Dr. Kendall has
been president since 1884, and Mr. Edmund Todd hon. secretary
since 1902.</p>

<p>The Baptist Chapel was built in 1837, the youngest of many
chapels described in a booklet entitled <i>Old Baptist Meeting-houses
in Furness</i>, by F. N. Richardson (1904). Tottlebank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the oldest, was founded in 1669. Sunnybank, in Torver, 1678,
and Hawkshead Hill, founded a few years later, no doubt took
the early Baptists of Coniston; one of whom, William Atkinson
of Monk Coniston, tanner, was fined in 1683 for attending a
conventicle. These three chapels are now open, though
Sunnybank and Hawkshead Hill were closed for some years
before 1905. The seventeenth century chapel at Scroggs,
between Broughton and Coniston, was dilapidated in 1842,
and is now a cattle shed. The Coniston Chapel ministers
were Mr. Kirkbride, Mr. Myers, and then for twenty-one years
from about 1865 the Rev. George Howells; he was succeeded
by Rev. Arthur Johnson. For nine years before 1904 there
was no Baptist congregation, and the chapel was let to the
"Brethren," who built a place of worship for themselves and
opened it 1903. The Baptist Sunday School had been carried
on all the while by Mr. William Shaw, and on regaining
possession of the chapel a congregation was once
more formed with Rev. R. Jardine as pastor.</p>

<p>A Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1859, but some
years ago was converted into a Masonic Hall. A Wesleyan
Chapel was built in 1875, but there is no settled minister.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Chapel was built in 1872 by Miss
Aglionby of Wigton; Prof. Ruskin gave a window to this
chapel. It was served for many years by Father Gibson; on
his removal he was succeeded by Father Laverty, at whose
death in 1905 Father Bradshaw was appointed to the cure.</p>

<h2>VIII.&mdash;CONISTON INDUSTRIES.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Copper.</span></h3>

<p>That the copper mines were worked by the Romans
and the Saxons is only a surmise. Dr. A. C. Gibson,
F.S.A., writing in 1866, said:&mdash;"Recent operations
have from time to time disclosed old workings which have
obviously been made at a very early period, by the primitive
method of lighting great fires upon the veins containing ore
and, when sufficiently heated, pouring cold water upon the
rock, and so, by the sudden abstraction of caloric, rending,
cracking and making a circumscribed portion workable by the
rude implements then in use, specimens of which are still
found occasionally in the very ancient parts of the mines,
especially small quadrangular wedges perforated for the
reception of a handle."</p>

<p>The mines of Cumberland were worked throughout the
Middle Ages, and it is not impossible that these rich veins in
the Coniston Fells were tried for ore; but we have no proof
of the local assertion that they have been worked continuously
since the days of the Romans. On the contrary, there seem
to have been only two periods, of about a century each, during
which mining was actively pushed. In the time of Queen
Elizabeth we reach firm ground of history.</p>

<p>In 1561 a company was formed by several lords and London
merchants to work the minerals of the kingdom under a patent
from the Crown. They invited two German mining experts,
Thomas Thurland and Daniel Hechstetter, who coming to
England opened mines, and built smelting works at Keswick
in 1565; and in spite of strong local opposition soon made a
great success. (Their proceedings are described in a paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by J. Fisher Crosthwaite, F.S.A., in <i>Transactions</i> of the now
defunct Cumberland Association, viii.)</p>

<p>They also took over the Coniston mines, and worked them
with energy and profit. They opened out no less than nine
new workings beside the old mine&mdash;the New or White Work,
Tongue Brow (in Front of Kernel Crag), Thurlhead, Hencrag,
Semy Work, Brimfell, Gray Crag, the Wide Work, and the
Three Kings in Tilberthwaite; employing about 140 men.
The ore was raised at a cost of 2s. 6d. to 8s. a kibble, each
kibble being about a horse load, for it was carried on pack-horses
to Keswick for smelting. To avoid this they proposed
building a smelting house at Coniston, which was, they said,
well supplied with wood and peat, and an iron forge was
already there. It would be easy to boat the manufactured
copper down the water, and ship it at Penny Bridge.</p>

<p>But in the civil wars the Corporation of "Governors,
Assistants, and Commonalty of the Mines Royal" came to an
end. The Parliament soldiers wrecked the works at Keswick,
and operations at Coniston were stopped.</p>

<p>After the civil wars, Sir Daniel Fleming was several times
approached on the subject of reopening the mines. He seems
to have been willing. He notes on January 21st, 1658, "given
unto the miller of Conistone for going along with me on to the
fell, 1s.;" and on March 22nd, "given to Parce Corratts when
hee came to looke at the blacke lead mine at Conistone, 2/6."
This turned out a disappointment, for on May 2nd, 1665, he
says, "given unto a Newlands man who came to look at the
<i>supposed</i> wadd-mine at Coniston, 5/-." And so nothing seems
to have been done.</p>

<p>In 1684 Roger Fleming at the Hall sent his brother, Sir
Daniel, a report of the mines "which were first wrought by
the Dutchmen" (Keswick Germans) and others discovered
more recently. Only three of the old workmen were living,
but from their evidence we get the details given above. On
May 25th, 1686, John Blackwall wrote from Patterdale to Sir
Daniel that he had examined the ground at Coniston and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
studied the evidence of the three old miners, and was prepared
with a company to open the mines, if they could agree
upon terms.</p>

<p>Sir Daniel died in 1701; and the Rev. Thomas Robinson's
<i>Natural History of Cumberland</i>, &amp;c., published in 1709, mentions
that copper had been formerly got at Cunningston, by the
Germans, and taken to Keswick, but says nothing about a
revival of the industry. It was, however, prosecuted in a
small way throughout the eighteenth century. A Company of
Miners at Ulpha is mentioned in George Bownass' account
for tools in 1772. West says, in 1774, merely, "the fells of
Coniston have produced great quantities of copper ore,"
nothing of mining in his time; and the smith's accounts from
1770 to 1774 do not mention it. There must have been a
revival shortly afterwards. Captain Budworth, about 1790,
tells the story of the devil and the miner, retold by Dr. Gibson
from local tradition, to the effect that Simon the miner found
a paying vein in the crag&mdash;it is called Simon Nick to this day,
and the cleft he made is seen yet on the left hand as you go
up to Leverswater; but one night at the Black Bull he boasted
of his luck, and said the fairies, or the devil, were his partners,
upon which he found no more copper, and lost his life soon
after in blasting.</p>

<p>In 1802 the mines were going. In 1820 the <i>Lonsdale
Magazine</i> says that they had been worked at intervals for
many centuries, and had lately been in the hands of "spirited
adventurers," but were then discontinued.</p>

<p>About 1835 a new era of prosperity began, in which Mr.
John Barratt became the leader. His skill and energy brought
about such success that in 1849 they employed 400 men, and
yielded 250 tons of ore monthly. In 1855 the monthly wage
list amounted to £2,000. In 1866 Dr. Gibson said:&mdash;"For
many years their shipments averaged 300 tons per month, and
employed from five to six hundred people," but "the number
of hands employed do not now exceed two hundred."</p>

<p>Up to this time the ore had been boated down the lake, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
carted to Greenodd. Now the Coppermining Company promoted
a railway connecting Coniston with Broughton and the
Furness line. It was a separate concern when it was opened
in 1859, but absorbed into the Furness system in 1862.</p>

<p>The mines, as they were in his days, are described at length
by Dr. Gibson in <i>The Old Man, or Ravings and Ramblings
around Conistone</i>. Alexander Craig Gibson, M.R.C.S., F.S.A.,
was born at Harrington, 1813, the son of a ship's captain,
who died early. He was taken by his mother to her home at
Lockerbie, and brought up there; afterwards apprenticed to
a surgeon at Whitehaven. In 1844 he came to Coniston as
medical officer to the mining company, and lived for seven
years at Yewdale Bridge, where he wrote his "Ravings and
Ramblings" as articles for the <i>Kendal Mercury</i>, afterwards
collected into a volume, and subsequently republished with
considerable revision. He left Coniston in January, 1851, and
remained at Hawkshead for some years; then removed southward,
and finally settled at Bebington in Cheshire, where he
died in 1874. A collection of sketches in prose and verse, <i>The
Folk-speech of Cumberland</i>, &amp;c. (Coward, Carlisle, 1869; ed. ii.,
1872), shows him to be master of the dialect of the north-west
in various forms&mdash;Furness, Cumbrian, and Dumfriesshire;
and his book on Coniston remains a valuable contribution to
local anecdote. (I owe the data of his life to the Rev. T.
Ellwood.)</p>

<p>After the middle of the nineteenth century the copper mines
became less and less profitable, owing to the competition of
foreign imports. During the "eighties," they were only just
kept open, until the Coniston Mining Syndicate, under the
energetic management of Mr. Thomas Warsop, tried to put
new life into the old business. Mr. Warsop attempted to
introduce a new system of smelting, but this smelting house
was blown away by the storm of December 22nd, 1894. He
took the watercourse from Leverswater to work a turbine,
which superseded the old waterwheels for pumping, and also
supplied power for boring in the mines, and for crushing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
mixing the material from the old rubbish heaps, with which
he made excellent concrete slabs, much in demand for pavements.
But the development came to an end with Mr.
Warsop's removal in 1905, and when the mines were offered
for sale there was no purchaser.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iron.</span></h3>

<p>In our tour of the lake we have noticed that there are
remains of old iron works along its margin, now difficult to
trace.</p>

<p>In High Furness, the district of which Coniston Lake is the
centre, and the most northern part of Lancashire, there are
about thirty known sites where iron was smelted in the
ancient way with charcoal, producing a <i>bloom</i>&mdash;the lump of
metal made by <i>blowing</i> in the furnace&mdash;whence the name
<i>bloomeries</i>. Of these sites about half are in the valley of
Coniston, and eight are actually on the shore of the lake:&mdash;</p>

<p>All these have been bloomeries of a somewhat similar kind,
and on Peel Island some iron works have been carried on of a
rather different type, and perhaps at a different period. Small
bloomeries have also been in blast at Tom-gill (the beck
coming down from the Monk Coniston Tarns, often called
Glen Mary), and at Stable Harvey in Blawith. One is said
to be at the limekiln in Yewdale. There were two bloomeries
of the later and larger type at Coniston Forge (up stream
from the church) and at Low Nibthwaite, and two others
further down the Crake, making sixteen in all the valley now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
known. There are, of course, many beside in the Lake
District, as in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>That there were iron works before the Conquest in Furness
appears from the place-name of "Ouregrave" in <i>Domesday</i>,
which must be identical with Orgrave. At this place, early in
the thirteenth century, Roger of Orgrave gave Furness Abbey
the mine "cum ... aquæ cursu ad illam scil. mineriam
lavandum," a grant confirmed by his son Hamo in 1235
(<i>Coucher Book of Furness</i>, p. 229). About 1230 Thomas le
Fleming gave them iron mines in Elliscales. By 1292 a great
part of their income was derived from iron works.</p>

<p>Canon Atkinson, in his introduction to the <i>Coucher Book of
Furness</i>, c. xviii., reckoned that they must have had some forty
hearths to produce the iron they made. When the wood near
the mines was exhausted, it became easier to carry the ore to
the place where charcoal was burned than to bring the charcoal&mdash;so
much greater in bulk&mdash;to the ore. An acre of forest
was not enough to supply charcoal for smelting two tons of
metal, and so the woods were gradually devastated over a
wider and wider area.</p>

<p>In 1240 the abbey, which owned the eastern side of the
lake, but not the lake itself, got leave from the baron of
Kendal to put boats on the lake of Coniston for fishing and
carrying. The carrying was chiefly of timber for building,
but the tops and branches were no doubt used for charcoal.
That on the other shore the smelting works were creeping up
the valley is seen from the grant, before 1282, of William de
Lancaster to Conishead Priory of the dead wood in Blawith
for charcoal to supply the canons' bloomeries&mdash;for it was not
only Furness Abbey that dealt in iron; and, indeed, more
bloomeries exist on the side that did not belong to the abbey
than on the shore that did. Thus in the thirteenth century
we infer that smelting went on by Coniston Lake shore well
up the west side.</p>

<p>On the east side there is a remarkable coincidence between
the sites of Furness Abbey "parks" (or early clearings for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
sheep farms) and the bloomeries we find there. Near Selside
Beck, where slag has been found, is Waterpark&mdash;anciently
Water-side-park, apparently the earliest of the abbey sheep
farms. Above Parkamoor Beck bloomery is Parkamoor&mdash;the
sheep farm on the moor. Above Beck-leven bloomery is
Lawson Park, the latest of the Furness Abbey sheep farms.
I think the inference is that when the land was cleared they
put sheep on it, and went up the lake to the next beck for the
site of their bloomery. What we know for certain is that in
early times the valley of Coniston was thickly wooded, but by
the time of the dissolution of the monastery, High Furness
had been nearly denuded of timber.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the monastery, the commissioners
of Henry VIII. let part of the woods of Furness Fells to
William Sandys and John Sawrey, to maintain three smithies,
or combined smelting and hammering works, for which the
rent was £20. Less than thirty years later, in 1564-5, these
were suppressed, because it was represented that the woods
were being wasted, and the £20 rent was thenceforward paid
to the lord of the manor by the customary tenants as
"bloomsmithy rent."</p>

<p>The tenants of High Furness were allowed to make iron for
themselves with the loppings and underwood, which may
account for some of the small bloomeries. But by this time
an improved and larger furnace was beginning to come into
fashion, and in the seventeenth century we find that one such
existed at Coniston at the Forge, between the Black Bull and
Dixon Ground. It is mentioned in 1650 by the German
miners, and by Sir Daniel Fleming in 1675. In 1750 it was
turning out eighty tons of bar iron a year, and in 1771
Thomas Tyson is mentioned as the ironmaster (George
Bownass' accounts). This would suffice for the needs of the
neighbourhood, while at the same time the Deerpark, which
we know was stocked in the seventeenth century and probably
was preserved in the sixteenth, would make impossible the
carrying on of smelting at Waterpark bloomery, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
within it, and at Springs, close to it. The relics from Peel
Island, associated with iron works, seem to be mediæval, and
the isolation of a forge on an island, as at Rampsholme in
Derwentwater, implies that protection was sought, which
would hardly be needed in Elizabethan and later times hereabouts.
The conclusion seems to be that many of the little
bloomeries are mediæval; that at Stable Harvey, perhaps the
work of Conishead Priory after the grant of 1282, and those
in Monk Coniston, the work of Furness Abbey.</p>

<p>The iron ore came from Low Furness, but there was an iron
mine at the Red-dell head under Weatherlam. The Rev.
Thomas Robinson, in his <i>Natural History of Westmorland and
Cumberland</i>, 1709, says "Langdale &amp; Cunningston mountains
do abound most with iron veins; which supplies with Ore &amp;
keeps constantly going a Furnace in Langdale, where great
plenty of good and malleable iron is made, not much inferior
to that of Dantzick."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Slate.</span></h3>

<p>Roofing slabs have been found in the ruins of Calder Abbey
and the Well Chapel at Gosforth, both mediæval; in the
mansion on Lord's Island, Derwentwater, destroyed before
the end of the seventeenth century, we found green Borrowdale
roofing slates. Purple Skiddaw roofing slates were also
found in the ruins of a seventeenth and eighteenth century
cottage at Causeway Head near Keswick. But it was not
until the eighteenth century that quarrying began to develop.
Mr. H. S. Cowper, in his <i>History of Hawkshead</i>, says that the
Swainsons, from about 1720, worked a quarry in the Coniston
flag formation near the Monk Coniston Tarns, and sent out
their flags even as far as Ulverston Church. Fifty years later
George Bownass, the Coniston blacksmith, was the great purveyor
and repairer of tools, and from his ledger the names of
his customers, gathered by Mr. Herbert Bownass, throw light
on the history of the industry in the second half of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1770 appear William Jackson &amp; Co. and Edward Jackson,
no doubt of Tilberthwaite. In 1771, the Company of Slate-getters
at Pennyrigg, Saddlestones, Cove and Hodge Close;
Zachias Walker &amp; Co., at Cove; George Tyson &amp; Co., quarry
owners; William Atkinson &amp; Co., at Scoadcop Quarry; John
Masacks &amp; Co., at Cove; John Atkinson, slate merchant,
Torver Fell Quarry; Wm. Fleming and Thomas Callan, Stang
End Quarry; Matthew Carter, Stang End Quarry; also
George Thompson and Wm. Vickers at a quarry with an
unreadable name, and John Johnson, Jonathan Youdale, Wm.
Wilson, Anthony Rigg and Wm. Stopart, slate-getters. In
1772, William Atkinson, Broadscop Quarry; John Speding &amp;
Co., quarry owners; slate-getters at Bove Beck or Gatecrag
Quarries; Wm. Parker, slate merchant, Langdale; Wm.
Fleming, Bessy Crag Quarry; Wm. Johnson, Pennyrigg
Quarry; and John Vickers, Thomas and Rowland Wilson,
John Casson, and George Bownass, slate-getters.</p>

<p>Of the quarries here mentioned as working 130 years ago
Stang End and Bessy Crag are in Little Langdale, Pennyrigg
and Hodge Close on opposite sides of the Tilberthwaite valley;
Cove is on the flank of the Old Man above Gaitswater;
Scoadcop and Broadscop look like variants of the name
Goldscope, the quarry opposite Cove, and near Blind Tarn,
to the right hand as you go up Walna Scar; Torverfell Quarry
may be Ashgill; Saddlestones is the quarry seen on the way
up the Old Man (page 3).</p>

<p>Father West in 1774 said that "the most considerable slate
quarries in the kingdom" were in the Coniston Fells; the
slate was shipped from Penny Bridge "for differents parts of
the kingdom." In 1780, Green saw the quarry near the top
of the Old Man "in high working condition." W. Rigge &amp;
Son of Hawkshead, who worked some of them, exported 1,100
tons and upward a year, and the carriage to Penny Bridge
was 6s. 10d. to 7s. 10d. a ton. The slate was shipped at
Kirkby Quay upon sailing boats, of which there were enough
upon the water in 1819 to furnish the subject of a paragraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in Green's <i>Guide</i> describing a scene of "bustle and
animation."</p>

<p>From papers given by Mr. John Gunson of Ulpha to the
Coniston Museum, we can gather a few particulars of the slate
trade in the early part of the nineteenth century. John Atkinson
of Ivytree, Blawith, in 1803 was interested in the Tilberthwaite
Quarries, and in 1804 applied for leave to redeem the
Land Tax on the ground they covered, the annual sum being
£2 13s. 4d. From 1820 we find John Atkinson &amp; Co. working
seven quarries&mdash;Ashgill (to the left hand as you go up Walna
Scar) the most important, occupying usually about a dozen
men, and worked at considerable profit until 1830, when it
began to show a deficit; Tilberthwaite, after 1820 giving
employment to about seven men, with fair profit until 1826,
when the men seem to have been withdrawn to work a quarry
at Wood in Tilberthwaite for a year and a half; Goldscope,
employing from nine to fifteen men between 1821 and 1826,
when the Cove Quarry seems to have been run with no great
profit or energy until 1832; and Mosshead, on the north-east
side of the Old Man, at the head of Scrow Moss, was worked
in 1829 and at a loss. The Outcast Quarry, near Slater's
Bridge (now Little Langdale Quarries), is mentioned only in
1830. The best workmen were paid 3s. 6d. a day; lads seem
to have started at 6d. There are notes of indentures, in
Atkinson's account-book, from which it seems that apprentices
at the riving and dressing began at 1s. or 1s. 6d., with a yearly
rise to 2s. 6d., before they were out of their time. The profits
were fluctuating&mdash;Goldscope in two years (1821-23) produced
£1,072 17s. worth of slates, and paid £719 18s. 10d. in wages;
Ashgill in 1826 made £381 less powder, tools, candles, &amp;c.;
but these were good years. The royalties to Lady le Fleming
on Cove and Mosshead for 1827-32 amounted to £33 6s.</p>

<p>Tilberthwaite was the old possession of the Jacksons. Their
ancestor had come from Gosforth, Cumberland, about 1690,
and is said to have acquired it by marriage from the Walkers,
who held the land in freehold, not, as usual hereabouts, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
customary tenure under a lord of the manor. The Jacksons
held most of Tilberthwaite, Holm Ground, and Yewdale until
their estates were bought by Mr. James Garth Marshall, and
it was by marriage with an Elizabeth Jackson that John
Woodburn of Kirkby Quarries came to have an interest in the
slate trade here. His name appears in John Atkinson's
account books after 1832, and he seems to have taken over
the actual working of the quarries. In 1904 the total output
of the Coniston quarries (Cove, High Fellside, Mossrigg and
Klondyke, Parrock, Saddlestone, and Walna Scar) was 3438
tons; value at the quarries, £12,251.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wood.</span></h3>

<p>In spite of local production, iron was not plentiful in the
eighteenth century. Iron nails were too valuable for common
use, though they are found in quantities at the old furnaces
on Peel Island and elsewhere, which must date from an earlier
period. Wooden pegs were substituted in making kists and
other furniture, house roofs, doors and boats. The trade in
woodwork of many kinds flourished in Coniston and its
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the sixteenth century "Cowpers
and Turners, with makyng of Coles," and the Baptist tanner
of Monk Coniston in the seventeenth century; his tannery
was, no doubt, that at Bank Ground. Another old tannery
was at Dixon Ground in Church Coniston. Bark peeling and
charcoal burning are among the most ancient and continuous
industries; the round huts of the charcoal burners and their
circular pitsteads can be traced, though overgrown and so
nearly obliterated as to resemble prehistoric remains, in many
of the woods, or places which once were wooded.</p>

<p>In George Bownass' ledger, already quoted, John Bell &amp; Co.
are named as wood-mongers in 1771, and in 1772 the same
smith repaired the "coal boate" owned by the executors of
William Ford.</p>

<p>In 1820 the old <i>Lonsdale Magazine</i> says that the woods were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
cut every fifteen or sixteen years, and brought in the same
value as if the land had been under cultivation. The wood
was used for charcoal in smelting (and later in gunpowder
making), for poles, hoops, and birch besoms; bird-lime was
made from the bark of the holly, and exported to the West
Indies.</p>

<p>As the Lancashire spinning increased there was a great
demand for bobbins, and large quantities of small copse wood
went to the turning mills. There was one near the Forge at
Coniston, and a later bobbin mill farther down stream at
Low Beck. Others were worked at Hawkshead Hill by W.
F. Walker, and more recently at Sunnybank in Torver. But
this industry has now died out.</p>

<p>An agreement in possession of Mr. H. Bownass, dated
February 13th, 1798, between John Jackson of Bank Ground,
gent. (landlord), and Robert Townson of the Gill, yeoman
(tenant), of the one part, and T. Mackreth of Bank Ground,
tanner, and John Gaskerth of Mattson Ground, Windermere,
woollen manufacturer, of the other, authorises the building of
a watermill for spinning and carding on the land called the
Becks and Lowlands in Church Coniston. The carding mill
near Holywath was owned early in the nineteenth century by
Mr. Gandy of Kendal, and managed by Mrs. Robinson of the
Black Bull.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The rise of Coniston trade is shown pretty accurately by
the returns of population in this period. In 1801 Church
Coniston contained 338 persons; in 1811, 460; in 1821, 566;
and in 1831, 587. At this last date there were 101 houses
inhabited and 9 empty, none building; and there were 102
families of which 25 were employed in agriculture, 65 in trade,
mining, &amp;c., and 12 beside. In Monk Coniston with Skelwith
the population in 1801 was 286; in 1811, 386; in 1821, 426;
and in 1831 it had dropped to 397. There were then 78 houses
occupied and 12 empty; 36 families lived by agriculture, 2 by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
trade or manufacture, and 41 otherwise. This means that the
village was always the home of the miners and quarrymen,
while "at the back of the water" there was a gradually
increasing settlement of gentlefolk attracted to the place by
its scenery. In the later half of the century the population of
Church Coniston, after reaching 1324 in 1861, fell to 1106 in
1871, 965 in 1881, and 964 in 1891; showing the decline of the
once flourishing industrial enterprises. During the next
decade the slate trade increased, and in 1901 the population
had risen to 1111, whence the new rows of houses which, if
not picturesque, were much needed. It is no longer possible
to crowd the cottages as in mid-Victorian days when, it is
said, the miners coming down from their work took the beds
<i>warm</i> from the men on the other shift. And yet, granting the
necessity, one cannot help regretting the meanness and ugliness
of much recent building in the village. A pleasant
exception is the new office for the Bank of Liverpool at the
bridge, which is a clever adaptation of the old cottage, making
a pretty effect without pretentiousness; and perhaps, with
this example, local enterprise may still create&mdash;what is far
from impossible&mdash;a little town among the mountains worthy
of its environment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>


<h2>IX.&mdash;OLD CONISTON.</h2>

<p>The poet Gray, author of <i>The Elegy in a Country
Churchyard</i>, in his tour of 1769, and Gilpin, in
search of the picturesque, in 1772, did not seem to
hear of Coniston as worth seeing. The earliest literary
description is that of Thomas West, the Scotch Roman-Catholic
priest, who wrote the <i>Antiquities of Furness</i> in 1774.
He illustrated his book with a map "As Survey'd by Wm.
Brasier 1745," in which are marked Coniston Kirk, Hall,
Waterhead, Townend, Thurston Water, Piel I., Nibthwaite,
Furnace, Nibthwaite Grange, Blawith Chap., Waterycot (by
obvious error for "yeat"), Oxenhouse, Torver Kirk, Torver
Wood (Hoathwaite), New Brig (the old pack-horse bridge),
White Maidens, Blind Tarn, Goat's Tarn, Low Water, Lever
Water, and so on, giving names in use 150 years ago.</p>

<p>West says:&mdash;"The village of Coniston consists of scattered
houses; many of them have a most romantic appearance
owing to the ground they stand on being extremely steep."
Later editions add:&mdash;"Some are snow white, others grey
... they are all neatly covered with blue slate, the produce
of the mountains, beautified with ornamental yews,
hollies, and tall pines or firs."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ann Radcliffe, author of the <i>Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and
other romantic novels, came here in 1794 or earlier; and after
describing the Rhine, and all the other lakes, found Thurston
Lake "one of the most interesting, and perhaps the most
beautiful," though she took the Hall for a Priory, and sentimentalised
about the "solemn vesper that once swelled along
the lake from these consecrated walls, and awakened, perhaps,
the enthusiasm of the voyager, while evening stole upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
scene." Conishead, not Coniston, was the Priory; the confusion
between the two has been often made.</p>

<p>With fuller knowledge and from no hasty glance, Wordsworth
soon afterwards described the same spot (<i>Prelude</i>,
VIII.):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">A grove there is whose boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch from the western marge of Thurston mere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With length of shade so thick that whoso glides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the line of low-roofed water, moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a cloister. Once&mdash;while in that shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loitering I watched the golden beams of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silent beauty on the naked ridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a high eastern hill&mdash;thus flowed my thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear native regions, wheresoe'er shall close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mortal course, there will I think on you....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Need I quote farther the famous outburst of patriotism?&mdash;it
was our lake that roused it. And another great enthusiasm
was stirred by our Coniston Fells.</p>

<p>In 1797 the landscape painter Turner came here as a youth
of 23 on his first tour through the north. After his pilgrimage
among the Yorkshire abbeys, so finely described by Ruskin in
<i>Modern Painters</i>, vol. v., the young artist seems to have arrived
among the fells one autumn evening, and sketched the Old
Man from the Half-penny Alehouse. Then&mdash;I piece this
together from the drawings and circumstances&mdash;he went round
to spend the night at the Black Bull with old Tom Robinson
and his wife, the daughter of Wonderful Walker. She was a
wonderful woman herself; had been first a miner's wife,
helping him to rise to a clerkship at the Leadhill Mines in
Dumfriesshire, and on his death returning to Seathwaite;
then, sorely against her old father's will, taking up with Tom,
and settling at Townend to farm; afterwards for many years
at the Black Bull, keeping the inn, managing the carding mill,
and acting as parish officer in her turn; a notable figure, in
mob cap and bedgown and brat; sharp tongued and shrewd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of judgment. What did she make, I wonder, of the sunburnt,
broad-shouldered lile cockney, with his long brown curls, his
big nose and eagle eyes, and his sketch-book, "spying
fancies?" Early in the morning he was out and scrambling
up Lang Crags. It was one of the magical, misty autumnal
sunrises we know so well. There had been rain, and Whitegill
was full, thundering down the precipice at his feet. The
fog was breaking away from the valley beneath, and rising in
drifts and swirls among the clefts of Raven Crag, and the
woods of Tilberthwaite. Far away, serene in the morning
light, stood Helvellyn. It was his earliest sight of the
mountain glory; the thrill of emotions never to be forgotten.
Going home to London, he painted his first great mountain
subject, afterwards in the National Gallery&mdash;the first picture
for which he was moved to quote poetry in the Academy
catalogue, and this from <i>Paradise Lost</i>&mdash;"Morning on Coniston
Fells:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye mists and exhalations that now rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hill or streaming lake, dusky or grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honour to the world's Great Author rise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By this time the fashion of visiting the lakes was coming in,
enough to give employment to a guide&mdash;Creighton, whom
Captain Budworth, about 1790, described as a self-taught
scholar, claiming descent from a noble family in Scotland, and
fond of bragging about the nobility he had taken up the fells.
His son William was something of a genius; he was found
here by John Southern of Soho drawing a map of the world
with home-made mathematical instruments, but using them
with immense skill. Mr. Southern took him into his drawing
office, and young Creighton, by hard study, became a considerable
linguist, astronomer, and cartographer.</p>

<p>To the old Black Bull, De Quincey came from Oxford in
1806 to see Wordsworth. Next year William Green, the
artist and guide-book writer, was there, and went up Walna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Scar with Robinson. Mrs. Robinson died in extreme old age,
and afterwards Adam Bell was landlord (1849); in 1855,
Edward Barrow.</p>

<p>The tourist business made more hotels necessary. In 1819
the old Waterhead Inn was called the New Inn as distinguished
from the Black Bull. It stood at the head of the lake, where
now is the plantation between the letter-box and the sign-post.
In Holland's aquatint view (1792), a rambling farmhouse is
shown there, but not called an inn. This became a favourite
stopping place for tourists. John Ruskin's father was fond of
it, and often stayed there alone or with his family. But John
Ruskin, returning in 1867, wrote&mdash;"Our old Waterhead Inn,
where I was so happy playing in the boats, <i>exists</i> no more."
The present hotel was built by Mr. Marshall in 1848-49, and
tenanted by Mr. Atkinson, afterwards by Mr. and Mrs. Sly,
and now by Mr. Joseph Tyson.</p>

<p>In 1849 the landlord of the Crown was Isaac Massicks. The
Ship, in 1849, was kept by John Aitkin; the Rising Sun, in
1855, by James Harker. The old Half-penny Alehouse was
pulled down in 1848 to build Lanehead.</p>

<p>To tell the story of the many "worthies" of Coniston, and
to trace the fortunes of 'statesman families often wandering
far into the world, and winning a fair share of renown, would
need a volume to itself. One or two names we can hardly
omit&mdash;such as Lieut. Oldfield of Haws Bank, who piloted the
fleet into Copenhagen, and received his commission from
Nelson for that deed; and Sailor Dixon, who fought under
Howe on the first of June and under Duncan at Camperdown;
twice taken prisoner, once retaken and once escaping from
Dunkirk; implicated in the great mutiny of 1797, and yet
acquitted by court martial, he lived at Coniston to the age of
71.</p>

<p>With these might be mentioned the soldier John Jackson,
whose records of foreign service in the Crimea and elsewhere
are still extant. His cousin, the late Roger Bownass, left
many papers of interest to the student of Old Coniston. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
first of his family came in 1710 from Little Langdale, and
bought from William Fleming of Catbank for thirteen pounds
odd the smith's shop at the place called Chapel Syke, <i>i.e.</i>,
where the Crown Inn bar is now; a stream rising above the
Parsonage used to cross the road there, whence the name. He
bought also the old Catbank Farmhouse and its land now
covered with cottages. His son was about twelve or fourteen
in 1745, and told the writer of the manuscript history of the
family that he remembered taking a cartload of cannon balls,
forged at the smithy, to Kendal for the Duke of Cumberland's
army.</p>

<p>By 1773 a new site was needed for the smithy, and it was
moved to Bridge End, where the Post Office now stands, on land
bought from William Pennington of Kendal, wool comber, by
George Bownass, son of the original blacksmith who by this
time had died at the age of 87. Here a large business was
carried on in quarry and edge tools, employing a number of
men and apprentices; and profitable enough to enable the
owner to buy many plots of land round about, to which his
son William, who inherited the business, added other purchases,
and still managed to save £100 a year. William
Bownass died in 1818, and was the first person buried after
the rebuilding of the church; of his seven children, Isaac, of
Queen's College, Cambridge, became a successful schoolmaster,
but died at the age of 28, and Roger, for 45 years
postmaster at Coniston, died in 1889. Old George Bownass,
the second of the name, died a year later than his son William;
one of his daughters married a Coniston man, William
Gelderd, who became the first mayor of Kendal after the
passing of the new Municipal Act.</p>

<p>In the Christmas number, 1864, of the old Liverpool
<i>Porcupine</i> is a short story by Dr. Gibson which, if we read
<i>Bownass</i> for "Forness," <i>Spedding</i> for "Pedder," and <i>Coniston</i>
for "Odinsmere," as the writer certainly intended, becomes a
very vivid and interesting picture of Coniston folk and their
surroundings at the beginning of the last century. It describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the smith "George Forness" as the well-to-do and industrious
craftsman, in his busy workshop, surrounded by the village
gossips at Candlemas. To him enters "old Matthew Pedder,"
bound next morning for Ulverston, to settle accounts. The
smith entrusts him with money to pay his iron bill at Newlands,
and save himself a journey. The next scene shows us
a lane through the deerpark before dawn; Matthew on his
half-broken mare attacked by a wastrel who has overheard
the conversation, and now tries his unaccustomed hand at
highway robbery. The mare throws him down, and Matthew
gallops away believing his unknown assailant to be dead.
Ten months later Matthew is called from his house in Tilberthwaite
to the death-bed of Tom Bratton, and comes back
subdued and silent. "What did he want wi' yee?" his family
clamoured. "To ex me to forgive him." "Then it <i>was</i> him
'at tried to rob ye?" "Niver ye mind wha tried to rob me&mdash;neahbody
<i>did</i> rob me!" "And what did ye say till him?"
"I ext him to forgive me, and we yan forgev t'udder."</p>

<p>The slackness of anything like police in those days is
illustrated by a document in possession of Mr. John Bell,
which is an agreement dated 1791 on the part of leading
villagers to form a sort of Trades Defence Association to
preserve their property from "the Depredation of Highwaymen,
Robbers, Housebreakers and other Offenders." It is
signed by Edward Jackson, Isaac Tubman, Geo. Bownas (the
smith), James Robinson, George Dixon, John Gelderd, David
Kirkby, John Dawson, and by Thomas Dixon for Mr. John
Armstrong, each of whom subscribed eighteen pence to found
the association, and resolves in strictly legal form to stand by
his neighbours in all manner of eventualities.</p>

<p>The smith's ledger, already quoted, gives also a number of
farmer's names in 1770-74, which may be worth recording as
a contribution to the history of Coniston folk. At Littlearrow
lived John Fleming and Wm. Ion; at Spone How (Spoon
Hall), Geo. Dixon; at Heathwaite, John Fleming; at Bowmanstead,
T. Dixon and T. Parke; at Dixon Ground, John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Ashburner; at Catbank, Roger Tyson; at Brow, T. Bainbridge;
at Bove Beck, Wm. Dixon; at Far End, Wm. Parke;
at Tarnhouse (Tarn Hows), John Johnson; at "Utree," Geo.
Walker; at Oxenfell, Christopher Huertson; at Tilberthwaite,
John Jackson; at Holme Ground, Wm. Jackson; at Lane
End, Henry Dawson; at Waterhead, Anthony Sawrey; at
Hollin Bank, John Suert; at Bank Ground, John Wilson; at
Howhead, Eliz. Harrison; at Town End (Coniston Bank),
Ed. Barrow and Wm. Edrington; at Lowsanparke (Lawson
Park), Wm. Adinson. Other well-known names are Adam
Bell (Black Bull), John Bell, John Geldart, T. Gasketh, G.
Knott, David Kirkby, Matthew Spedding, T. and W. Towers.
Many of these names are still represented in the neighbourhood,
but the old 'statesman holdings have nearly all passed
into alien hands.</p>

<p>A list dated between 1830 and 1840 enumerates the acreage
of fifty-three separate estates in Church Coniston, ranging
from the Hall (Lady le Fleming's), over 397 acres, and
Tilberthwaite (John Jackson's), over 135 acres, to Henry
Braithwaite's plot of 15 perches. But of the whole number
only twenty-five, or less than half, are smaller than ten acres.
In 1841 the list of Parliamentary voters for Church Coniston
gives twenty owners of house and land in their own occupation
out of forty-six voters. In this list, James Garth Marshall of
Leeds appears as owner of High Yewdale, occupied&mdash;no
longer owned&mdash;by a Jackson; but there are very few non-resident
landlords on the list.</p>

<p>So late as 1849 the directory mentions as 'statesmen owning
their farms in Monk Coniston and Skelwith, Matthew Wilson
of Hollin Bank, John Creighton of Low Park, and William
Burns of Hodge Close; in Church Coniston, William Barrow
of Little Arrow, William Dixon of Dixon Ground, Benjamin
Dixon of Spoonhall, James Sanders of Outhwaite, and William
Wilson of Low Beck.</p>

<p>But after the "discovery" of the lakes, in the last quarter
of the eighteenth century, Coniston began to be the resort of
strangers in search of retirement and scenery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1801, Colonel George Smith, after losing a fortune in a
bank failure, settled at Townson Ground, and some years later
built Tent Lodge, so called from the tent his family had
pitched on the spot before the house was built, as a kind of
"station," as it was then called, for admiring the view. Here
in the tent, they say, his daughter used to sit, dying of consumption,
and looking her last on the favourite scene. Elizabeth
Smith was a girl of great charm and unusual genius.
Born in 1776, at thirteen she had learnt French, Italian, and
mathematics; at fifteen, she taught herself German; at
seventeen, she studied Arabic, Persian, and Spanish; and at
eighteen, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. While living here she
wrote much verse and many translations, of which her <i>Book
of Job</i> was highly commended by scholars; the manuscript in
her handwriting, with a copy of her portrait, may be seen in
the Coniston Museum. She died in 1806, and is buried at
Hawkshead.</p>

<p>After the death of Mrs. Smith, Tent Lodge was bought by
Mr. Marshall, and occupied by Tennyson the poet on his
honeymoon. His favourite point of view is still marked in the
wood above by a seat now hidden among the trees. Later, the
Misses Romney, descendants of the famous painter, lived at
Tent Lodge; then it was taken by the late George Holt, Esq.,
of Liverpool.</p>

<p>At Colonel Smith's removal to the Lodge, Tent Cottage, as
it is now called, was taken by Mrs. Fletcher, one of whose
daughters became Lady Richardson and another married
Dr. Davy, brother of Sir Humphrey Davy. Dr. Townson
succeeded them at the Cottage; then Mr. Oxley of the sawmills;
then the Gasgarths, on their removal from the Hall;
then Mr. Evennett, agent to Mr. Marshall. Afterwards it was
taken by Mr. Laurence Jermyn Hilliard, secretary to Mr.
Ruskin. Mr. Hilliard died in 1887 just as he was beginning to
be well known as an artist; he is commemorated in a brass
tablet in the church, and some examples of his work are to be
seen in the Museum. Since his death Tent Cottage has been
tenanted by his brother and sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1819 Mr. Thomas Woodville bought from Sir D. Fleming
a house called Yewdale Grove at Yewdale Bridge. In 1821
Mr. Binns of Bristol built the Thwaite House, and let it in
1827 to Mr. William Beever, a Manchester merchant, who died
four years later, leaving two sons and four daughters,
whose memory is very closely associated with Coniston. John,
the eldest son, was a sportsman and naturalist; the author of
a little volume entitled <i>Practical Fly-fishing</i>, published in 1849,
and republished 1893, a memoir of the author (now again
out of print). The pond behind the Thwaite was made by
him, and stocked with fish; once a year he used to catch
every member of his water colony, and examine it to note its
growth. The picturesque "Gothic" boat house, now the
gondola house, was built for his use. One of his hobbies was
the improvement of fishing-rods, and Mr. William Bell (afterwards
J.P. of Hawes Bank, who died in 1896) remembered
helping Mr. Beever in this and other carpentering, turning,
carving, and mosaic works, and in the construction of the
printing press used for his sister's little books. John Beever
died in 1859, aged 64. His brother Henry was a Manchester
lawyer, and died 1840.</p>

<p>Of the four ladies of the Thwaite, Miss Anne Beever died in
1858, and is buried with her brothers at Hawkshead. Miss
Margaret (d. 1874), Miss Mary (d. 1883), and Miss Susanna
(d. 1893) are buried at Coniston; their graves are marked by
white marble crosses close to Ruskin's. Indeed, though their
local influence and studies, especially in botany (see, for
example, Baxter's <i>British Flowering Plants</i> and Baker's <i>Flora
of the Lake District</i>, to which they contributed, and the
Rev. W. Tuckwell's <i>Tongues in Trees and Sermons in Stones</i>,
describing their home), give them a claim to remembrance,
their name is most widely known through Miss Susanna
Beever's popular <i>Frondes Agrestes, readings in "Modern
Painters,"</i> and through the correspondence of Ruskin with
Miss Mary and Miss Susanna published as <i>Hortus Inclusus</i>.
In his preface to the last he spoke of them as "at once sources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and loadstones of all good to the village in which they had
their home, and to all loving people who cared for the village
and its vale and secluded lake, and whatever remained in
them, or around, of the former peace, beauty, and pride of
English Shepherd Land."</p>

<p>The old Thwaite Cottage, below the house, was tenanted
by the Gaskarths after the death of David Kirkby, Esq., the
last of the former owners, in 1814; and then for many years
it was the home of Miss Harriette S. Rigbye, daughter of
Major E. W. Rigbye of Bank Ground, and an accomplished
amateur of landscape painting. She died in 1894, aged 82,
and is buried beside her friends the Beevers in Coniston
Churchyard. The Thwaite Cottage was then let to Professor
J. B. Cohen of the Leeds University, whose works on organic
chemistry are well known.</p>

<p>The Waterhead estate was bought in the eighteenth century
from the Thompsons by William Ford of Monk Coniston (see
Mr. H. S. Cowper's <i>History of Hawkshead</i>, p. xvi.), and came
to George Knott (d. 1784) by marriage with a Miss Ford. Mr.
Knott was mentioned by Father West as having "made many
beautiful improvements on his estate." In 1822 a view of the
modern "Gothic" front of the house, now called Monk
Coniston Hall, was given in the <i>Lonsdale Magazine</i>. The poet
Wordsworth is said to have advised in the laying out of the
gardens. From Mr. Michael Knott the place was bought by
James Garth Marshall, Esq., M.P. for Leeds, whose son,
Victor Marshall, Esq., J.P., still holds it.</p>

<p>Holywath was built by Mr. John Barratt, the manager of
the mines in their prosperous days, and afterwards held by
his daughter, the wife of Colonel Bousfield. Mr. William
Barratt, his cousin, built Holly How on the site of an old
cottage; it was afterwards tenanted by Mrs. Benson, and is
now occupied by Mrs. Kennington. Mr. William Barratt's
son, James W. H. Barratt, Esq., J.P., now lives at Holywath.</p>

<p>In 1848 Miss Creighton of Bank Ground built Lanehead, on
the site of the old Half-penny Alehouse, for Dr. Bywater, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
tenanted it for many years. Miss Creighton left the estate to
the Rev. H. A. Starkie; the house was occupied later by Mrs.
Melly, and since 1892 by W. G. Collingwood.</p>

<p>Coniston Bank replaces the old homestead of Townend.
It was held in 1819 by Thomas North, Esq.; in 1849, by
Henry Smith, Esq.; in 1855, by Wordsworth Smith, Esq.;
subsequently by Major Benson Harrison, who let it for a time
to George W. Goodison, Esq., C.E., J.P., and then to Thomas
Docksey, Esq. In 1897 it was sold to Mrs. Arthur Severn,
who sold it to its present occupant, H. P. Kershaw, Esq.</p>

<p>Brantwood, that is to say the nucleus of the present house,
was built at the end of the eighteenth century by Mr. Woodville
on a site bought from the Gaskarths. It was sold to
Edward Copley, Esq., of Doncaster, whose widow died there
in 1830. In 1849 it was in the occupation of Josiah Hudson,
Esq., and the early home of his son, the Rev. Charles
Hudson, a founder of the Alpine Club, and one of the party
of young Englishmen who first climbed Mont Blanc without
guides. He joined in the first ascent of the Matterhorn, 1865,
and was killed in the accident on the descent.</p>

<p>The next resident was an artist, poet, and politician. Mr.
William James Linton was born at Mile-End Road in the
east of London in 1812; his father was of Scotch extraction.
After apprenticeship to a wood engraver at Kennington, he
worked for the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, and mixed with artists
and authors of the Liberal and advanced party, becoming
known as a writer, editor, and lecturer of much energy on the
Radical side. In 1849 he left London for Miteside in West
Cumberland, and in May, 1852, moved to Brantwood; after
a year's tenancy he bought the little house and estate of ten
acres, to which on the enclosure of the common six acres
more were added. At Brantwood he also rented the garden
and field between the house and the lake, and kept cows,
sheep, and poultry; he anticipated Ruskin in clearing part of
the land and cultivating it; in his volume of <i>Memories</i>
(Lawrence &amp; Bullen, 1895) he records the pleasures of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
country life, as well as some of the trials of that period. He
had been editing, and publishing at his own expense, a monthly
magazine called <i>The English Republic</i>, and this was taken up
again in 1854. Two young printers and a gardener came to
Brantwood and offered their services, as assistants in this
work; and with their help the magazine was printed in the
outhouse, which he decorated with mottoes, such as "God
and the People"&mdash;still to be traced in the roughcast on the
wall. But its cost, however economically produced, was more
than he could afford, and the magazine was dropped in April,
1855, after which he was employed on the woodcuts for the
edition of Tennyson's poems illustrated by Rossetti, Millais,
and other artists of the period. He tells how Moxon came to
call on him and hasten the work, but could not be received
into the house owing to serious illness; and how thankful he
was for a ten-pound note put into his hand by the considerate
publisher as they stood at the gate. At Brantwood Miss
Eliza Lynn came to nurse the first Mrs. Linton in her fatal
illness, and married Mr. Linton in 1858. At Brantwood she
wrote her novels <i>Lizzie Lorton</i>, <i>Sowing the Wind</i>, and <i>Grasp
your Nettle</i>; also <i>The Lake Country</i>, published in 1864. Mr.
Linton, in 1865, published <i>The Ferns of the Lake Country</i>, but
for some years he had not lived continuously at Brantwood,
and in 1866 he went to America, where he died in 1898. Mrs.
Lynn Linton's best known work was <i>Joshua Davidson</i>, written
later than her Coniston period; she died in London in 1898,
and was buried at Crosthwaite, Keswick. Portraits and relics
of the Lintons are to be seen in the Museum at Coniston.</p>

<p>Another poet, Gerald Massey, lived for a time at Brantwood,
and dated the dedication of a volume of his poems from that
address in May, 1860. He, like Linton, is known for his
advocacy of democratic opinions; indeed, it is said that
George Eliot took him for model in <i>Felix Holt the Radical</i>.</p>

<p>During the later years of Mr. Linton's ownership, Brantwood
was taken for the summer by the Rev. G. W. Kitchin,
now Dean of Durham. In 1871, however, Mr. Linton sold the
house to Prof. Ruskin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruskin as a child often visited Coniston, and in 1830 at the
age of eleven made his first written mention of the place in a
MS. journal now in the Museum. In his <i>Iteriad</i>, a rhymed
description of the tour of that date, he gave the first hint of
his wish to live in the Lake District, and in the winter of
1832-33, at the age of nearly fourteen, he wrote the well-known
verses which stood first in the earliest collection of his
poems:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I weary for the torrent foaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For shady holm and hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mind is on the mountain roaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My spirit's voice is still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crags are lone on Coniston ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>remembering first and foremost, not Snowdon or Scotland,
but Coniston. In 1837, as an Oxford man, he was here
again, making notes for his earliest prose work, <i>The Poetry of
Architecture</i>; and one of the illustrations was a sketch of the
Old Hall from the water, the view which became so familiar
afterwards from his windows at Brantwood.</p>

<p>Then for a while his interests turned to the cathedrals of
France, the palaces and pictures of Italy, and to the loftier
scenery of the Alps; but curiously enough he did not like the
Matterhorn at first&mdash;it was too unlike "Cumberland," he
said. In 1847, already a well-known author, he was looking
out for a house in the Lake District, and staying at Ambleside.
But the March weather was dull, and he had many
causes for depression. As he rowed on Windermere he pined
for the light and colour of southern skies. "The lake," he
wrote home, "when it is quite calm, is wonderfully sad and
quiet; no bright colour, no snowy peaks. Black water, as
still as death; lonely, rocky islets; leafless woods, or worse
than leafless; the brown oak foliage hanging dead upon
them; gray sky; far-off, wild, dark, dismal moorlands; no
sound except the rustling of the boat among the reeds." Next
year he revisited the lakes in spring, and wrote soon after
about a wild place he had found:&mdash;"Ever since I passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Shap Fells, when a child, I have had an excessive love for this
kind of desolation."</p>

<p>It was not, however, until 1867 that he revisited the Lakes.
He came to Coniston on August 10th and went up the Old
Man, delighted with the ascent. We have already quoted his
description of the view.</p>

<p>At last (it was in 1871, at the age of 52, being then Slade
Professor at Oxford) he fell into a dangerous illness, and lay
between life and death at Matlock. He was heard to say and
repeat:&mdash;"If only I could lie down beneath the crags of
Coniston!"</p>

<p>Before he was fairly well again he heard through his old
friend, Mr. T. Richmond, that a house and land at Coniston
were for sale. The owner, W. J. Linton, asked £1,500 for the
estate, and he bought it at once. In September he travelled
here to see his bargain and found the cottage, as it then was,
in poor condition; but, as he wrote, some acres "of rock and
moor and streamlet, and, I think, the finest view I know in
Cumberland&mdash;or Lancashire, with the sunset visible over the
same."</p>

<p>Next summer the house was ready for him, and thenceforward
became his headquarters. From June, 1889, till his
death he never left it for a night; indeed, the last time he
went so far as the village was on April 7th, 1893, when he
attended our Choral Society's concert.</p>

<p>It is needless to tell over again the story of his life at
Brantwood; to describe the house that he found a rickety
cottage, and left a mansion and a museum of treasures; the
gardens, woods, and moor he tended; the surroundings of
mountain and streamlet, bird and beast, child-pet and peasant
acquaintance, now familiar to the readers of his later books
and of the many books that have been written about him.
But here it must not be left unsaid that Coniston folk knew
him less as the famous author than as the kind and generous
friend; eccentric and not easily understood, but always to be
trusted for help; giving with equal readiness to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
churches, to the schools and Institute; and to these last
giving not only his money, but his strength and sympathy.
It was he who started the first carving classes, and promoted
the linen industry; he lectured in the village (December, 1883)
for local charities, and&mdash;what was perhaps most effective of
all&mdash;carried out in practice his principle of employing neighbours
rather than strangers, of giving the tradesfolk and
labourers of the valley a share in his fortunes and interests.
And perhaps in his death he did them almost a greater service.
It was in obedience to his wishes that the offer of a
funeral in Westminster Abbey was refused, and he was laid
to rest&mdash;January 25th, 1900&mdash;"beneath the crags of Coniston,"
so linking his name for ever with the place he loved.</p>
